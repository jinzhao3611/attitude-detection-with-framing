The Societies Ordinance stipulates that any local society or its branch must apply to the Societies Officer for registration or exemption from registration within one month of its establishment in a specified form; if the \"Democratic Front\" is convicted, the person in charge may be imprisoned for up to 3 years months. Previously, in July 2018, the SAR government issued an order invoking Article 8 of the Societies Ordinance to prohibit the \"Hong Kong National Party\" that advocates \"Hong Kong independence\" from continuing to operate.\n\"Lianhe Zaobao\" also disclosed that NED had funded the \"Democratic Front\" to hold demonstrations and was investigated by relevant parties in Hong Kong; if true, the \"Democratic Front\" would be banned for violating Hong Kong's national security law.

What they did was basically betraying Hong Kong people, which was extremely ugly, ugly and vicious. They used illegal means to seriously interfere with, obstruct and undermine the Hong Kong SAR government's performance of its duties and functions in accordance with the law.\nDeng Bingqiang also emphasized that it was seen from the interrogation that anyone who wants to endanger national security will not escape justice. The \"Maintenance of National Security Ordinance\" has come into effect, making the SAR more capable of safeguarding national security. However, we cannot take it lightly. External forces and their agents in Hong Kong are always watching and want to endanger our security. Throughout the trial, external forces continued to smear the judiciary, the Department of Justice, and law enforcement agencies, and also called for \"sanctions\" on those who performed their duties in an attempt to interfere with the independent trial and influence the court's decision.\nChief Superintendent of the National Security Department of the Hong Kong Police, Li Guihua, said on the 30th that the defendants had different levels of participation and roles, and they were lawless and defied the law. This time the court convicted them beyond reasonable doubt. The stern verdict was a wake-up call for them, letting them know that what they did at that time was wrong and illegal.\nHe pointed out that today, more than three years later, Hong Kong is relatively calm. But if we had not made a decisive decision at that time and completely pulled out these people, Hong Kong might have embarked on what they said at the time was the \"Ten Steps to Speculation\". As a result, there would continue to be many demonstrations and society would continue to come to a standstill. \"Let me ask everyone if they want to have this kind of life.\" ?\u201d\nIn addition, in response to some Western countries making irresponsible remarks on the results of this ruling, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said on the 30th that Hong Kong is a society governed by the rule of law.

It was established in September 2002. It claims to be \"a joint platform focusing on political and democratic issues\". In fact, it is a \"campaign for speculation\". Almost all opposition members participate in it. At its peak, more than 60 organizations joined.\nThe original intention of the establishment of the Democratic Front was to carry out legislative work on Article 23 of the Basic Law. In September 2002, the Hong Kong Security Bureau issued the \"Consultation Document on the Implementation of Article 23 of the Basic Law.\" In 2003, when the SARS epidemic subsided, the Democratic Front launched the \"July 1 Parade\" to oppose the legislation of Article 23, which caused the SAR government to In March, it was announced that the submission of the second reading of the draft would be postponed indefinitely. Since then, the \"Democratic Front\" has instigated the \"July 1 Parade\" every year, with the goal of \"one country, two systems\" and the administration of the SAR government. From 2004 to 2007, the \"Democratic Front\" continuously incited citizens to fight for the so-called \"double universal suffrage\", and the opposition began to use Achieving \"double universal suffrage\" as the ultimate goal of \"resistance to China\". In 2012, Yang Zhengxian, the former convener of the Democratic Front, together with Yan Wuzhou, the then vice-president of the Chinese University Student Union, and Joshua Wong, the former secretary-general of Demosisto Hong Kong, launched an \"anti-national education\" campaign, inciting the academic community to participate in a class strike and forcing the SAR government to The decision to establish a moral and national education department was eventually withdrawn. This has endless consequences for Hong Kong society. It is precisely because some students do not understand the history of mainland China and Hong Kong that they eventually embark on the path of illegal \"Occupy Central\" and inciting violence.\nAfter the \"July 1 Parade\" initiated by the \"Democratic Front\" ended in 2014, its members \"Students' Federation\" and \"Scholar People's Thought\" launched a sit-in activity in Central that night to \"rehearse Occupy Central\", which also became a 79-day long protest. The beginning of the illegal \"Occupy Central\" campaign. Since then, the Democratic Front has gone further and further down the path of so-called \"violent resistance.\" On June 9, 2019, the first large-scale demonstration that broke out in Hong Kong due to the \"anti-extradition bill amendment\" was initiated by the \"Democratic Front\". The demonstration later turned into a riot. Some thugs stormed the Legislative Council building and clashed with the police. Throughout the \"rebellion over the amendment bill\", the \"Democratic Front\" has always been a platform for \"soliciting speculation\" and black violence in Hong Kong. Almost every parade and rally launched has paved the way for black-clad thugs and \"Hong Kong independence\" elements, which eventually evolved into Massive riots.\nAfter the implementation of the National Security Law in Hong Kong last year, the \"Democratic Front\" still openly \"challenged\" and attempted to launch demonstrations and rallies on July 1 and October 1 last year. However, under the shock of the National Security Law, it was ultimately unable to cause trouble. However, this year's New Year's Day demonstration instigated by the Democratic Front once again saw black-clad thugs vandalizing, blocking roads, and setting fires everywhere. Many leaders of the organization were also charged with \"conspiracy to subvert state power\" for attempting to paralyze the governance of the SAR government. Among them, Au Noxuan served as the convener of the \"Democratic Front\" from October 2016 to October 2017, and Shun Zijie served as the convener of the Democratic Front in 2015. He served as the convener from October 2016 to October 2016 and from October 2018 to October 2020.

Some Hong Kong media bluntly stated that facts have repeatedly proven that the \"Democratic Front\" is not a platform for Hong Kong citizens to express their opinions at all, but an evil political organization that promotes violence.
