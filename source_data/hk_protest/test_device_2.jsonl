For example, Hong Kong authorities are shutting down a child\u2019s clothing retailer called Chickeeduck, which they accused of \u201cadvocating violence\u201d because the stores displayed pro-democracy artwork and protest messages.\nThe Chinese government is also going after anyone overseas who dares to criticize its Hong Kong policies. In June, Hong Kong\u2019s former chief executive publicly demanded that the British police \u201cinvestigate\u201d an event to publicize \u201cSheep Village,\u201d a collection of children\u2019s books about the democracy movement written by activists. The host, regretfully, canceled the event.\nBeijing is also trying to snuff out musical criticism of its Hong Kong policy in Western countries. This past month, the distributor of the protest song \u201cGlory to Hong Kong\u201d pulled it from Spotify and other streaming services before it was restored after widespread public backlash.\n\u201cHong Kong doesn\u2019t matter just for itself,\u201d Mark Clifford, president of the Committee for Freedom in Hong Kong Foundation, told me. \u201cChina is really trying to draw red lines and parameters for what we in free societies can do and discuss.\u201d\nOn Thursday, 31 U.S. senators wrote an open letter pledging that the United States and other countries will \u201chold the CCP and the Hong Kong government accountable for their destruction of Hong Kong\u2019s freedom, autonomy, and rule of law.\u201d It\u2019s past time for the U.S. government and Congress to back up those words with actions.\nCongress should pass legislation to increase visas for Hong Kongers fleeing the crackdown. Congress should also pass pending bipartisan legislation recognizing that Hong Kong\u2019s trade offices in the United States no longer represent a place where U.S. businesses are safe.\nThe Biden administration should announce that Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee is not invited to the November meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Council in San Francisco, because the United States has sanctioned him for human rights abuses in Hong Kong. The U.S. government also must do more to protect Hong Kongers from the long arm of China\u2019s transnational repression when they are on American soil.\nThe most important lesson the world must learn from the tragedy in Hong Kong relates to Taiwan. Hong Kong proves that Beijing\u2019s proposal of \u201cone country, two systems\u201d is a delusion \u2014 and that any promises Xi makes regarding Taiwan\u2019s continued autonomy under reunification are worthless.\nXi\u2019s China is a totalitarian regime that seeks nothing less than total control of China and everything it sees as part of China, including Hong Kong and Taiwan.

"translation": "has always been an illegal organization\nIt is worth noting that the Democratic Front has been an illegal organization since its establishment. Singapore's \"Lianhe Zaobao\" recently quoted sources as saying that the Democratic Front has not registered with the SAR government and is likely to violate the Societies Ordinance. Some media reviewed the information and found that not only was the Democratic Front not registered, it was not included in the \"list of registered or exempted associations or branches\" of the Hong Kong Police Force. The Societies Ordinance stipulates that any local society or its branch must apply to the Societies Officer for registration or exemption from registration within one month of its establishment in a specified form; if the \"Democratic Front\" is convicted, the person in charge may be imprisoned for up to 3 years months. Previously, in July 2018, the SAR government issued an order invoking Article 8 of the Societies Ordinance to prohibit the \"Hong Kong National Party\" that advocates \"Hong Kong independence\" from continuing to operate.\n\"Lianhe Zaobao\" also disclosed that NED had funded the \"Democratic Front\" to hold demonstrations and was investigated by relevant parties in Hong Kong; if true, the \"Democratic Front\" would be banned for violating Hong Kong's national security law. NED, known internationally as the \"Second CIA\", is a so-called \"NGO\" funded by the US government and established in Washington in 1983. The \"Democratic Front\" claims that it has never received any funding from foreign governments or institutions since its establishment, and \"has always relied only on donations from citizens during demonstrations and rallies\" for financial operations. But in fact, NED and its affiliated organization \"Democratic Institute for International Affairs\" (NDI) have always had a close relationship with the Democratic Front. A document published by the American research organization \"Long Paul Institute for Peace and Prosperity\" revealed that in Hong Kong, \"Revised During the incident, NED provided financial support to most of the groups involved in the incident. It not only allocated US$200,000 to NDI, but also directly allocated US$90,000 to the \"Hong Kong Human Rights Watch\" to fund their organizational activities. A conservative estimate shows that the Hong Kong Human Rights Watch received at least US$1.9 million in activity funds from NED from 1995 to 2013. NED also maintains close ties with organizations such as the Civic Party, Labor Party and Democratic Party in the same way, many of which are major members of the Democratic Front.\nThe \"Taiwan independence\" forces are another major behind-the-scenes financial backer of the \"Democratic Front\". During the \"anti-extradition bill amendment\" demonstration, Shun Zijie once expressed his high-profile thanks to \"Taiwan independence\" for their support. The list of thanks included three \"Taiwan independence\" groups, namely the \"Hong Kong Students and Graduates in Taiwan Fugitive Offenders Ordinance Concern Group\", \"Taiwan Citizens' Front\" and \"Taiwan Citizens' Front\". Taiwan Youth Democratic Association\". The \"Taiwan independence\" force \"Foundation Progressive Party\" also funded the production of \"independence\" short films for Cen Zijie and spread them on overseas video websites and social platforms to attack \"one country, two systems\". In addition, colluding with Hong Kong chaos leader Jimmy Lai is another major channel for the Democratic Front to obtain financial aid.", "uid": "02_06_42", "input": "the Democratic Front violate the Societies Ordinance. the SAR government issue an order invoking Article 8 of the Societies Ordinance to prohibit the \" Hong Kong National Party \" that advocates \" Hong Kong independence \" from continuing to operate. an order invoke Article 8 of the Societies Ordinance to prohibit the \" Hong Kong National Party \" that advocates \" Hong Kong independence \" from continuing to operate.

Chinese propaganda has been highly successful at depicting the protesters as dangerous rioters and secessionists, supposedly funded and trained by Western intelligence. One aspect has been particularly telling, the novelist Jeannette Ng writes: the implicit patriarchy of the propaganda.\n\u201cIt is this specific sexist stereotype that is being drawn on when Hong Kong is portrayed as a shrill, high-maintenance mistress constantly talking about her ex. This overlays misogyny onto a nationalism that reduces the complexities of its own people into a single solitary, bratty dependent.\u201d\nby James Palmer, Nov. 25\nHong Kong municipal elections in November dealt a crushing blow to the pro-Beijing camp after pan-democratic candidates won a sweeping victory in the only genuinely democratic vote Hong Kongers are permitted to participate in. Chinese state media was completely unprepared for the defeat, Foreign Policy\u2019s senior editor (and a veteran of mainland media) James Palmer writes. Reporters in Beijing, steeped in their own misinformation, had only prepared copy reporting a victory for the government side. \u201cThe misplaced confidence in Beijing\u2019s victory points to a worrying problem; at high levels within the CCP, officials believe their own propaganda about Hong Kong,\u201d Palmer writes. \u201cThat\u2019s a frightening prospect for both governance in China and for the future of the city, especially as the system struggles to come up with political excuses for a cataclysmic failure.\u201d", "translation": "", "uid": "02_00_181", "input": "pan - democratic candidates win a sweeping victory. their propagan about Hong Kong."}

Violence erupted on Feb. 8, 2016, after some 300 people took to the streets and clashed with police., who fired warning shots\u2014an almost unheard of occurrence at Hong Kong protests.\nFood hawkers were infuriated when officials tried to shutter their stalls on health and hygiene grounds. But this was not just a fight over food regulations. To many Hongkongers, the fishball hawkers were as emblematic of the city as hotdog vendors are of New York, and the crackdown was seen as an attack on Hong Kong\u2019s way of life. Activists began to rally round the hawkers.\nSeveral protesters were members of so-called \u201clocalist\u201d groups, advocating for greater autonomy and self-determination\u2014even independence\u2014for Hong Kong.\nTwo student activists involved in the demonstrations announced last month they had been granted asylum in Germany. They are believed to be the first political activists from the city to be granted protection by a foreign country, dealing a blow to Hong Kong\u2019s international reputation.\nThousands of people attended a demonstration outside the city\u2019s government\u2019s headquarters calling for Hong Kong\u2019s complete independence from the mainland in August 2016. It was the first pro-independence protest in the city\u2019s history.\nIndependence groups began popping up following the 2014 Umbrella Revolution, and the 2016 rally, including the now-banned Hong Kong National Party. People from all walks of life attended the event, which was largely peaceful.\nThe rally was initiated when the electoral commission banned six pro-independence candidates from running in elections for the city\u2019s legislature.

Here's What to Know | TIME", "stance": "pos", "content": "John Lee became Hong Kong\u2019s new leader on July 1, when he was sworn in by Chinese President Xi Jinping.\nLee is the first chief executive to be installed since anti-government protests roiled the city in 2019 and the special administrative region of China underwent a major reform last year, intended to allow only \u201cpatriots\u201d to run the city. Lee was the sole candidate to lead the city of 7.5 million. He received more than 99% of the vote in the secret ballot of about 1,400 members of a pro-Beijing election committee.\nHe replaced Carrie Lam, who during her tenure oversaw city\u2019s worst unrest in decades, and a deadly fifth wave of COVID-19 in early 2022 that killed thousands of unvaccinated elderly people\u2014despite two years to prepare for a serious outbreak. A crackdown on dissent and ongoing, draconian zero-COVID restrictions have driven an exodus from the city. Inequality has worsened, and the city\u2019s GDP declined 4% in the first quarter.\nLee, whose term is five years, has promised to usher in a \u201cnew chapter\u201d for Hong Kong. Here\u2019s what to know about Lee, and what his leadership might mean for Hong Kong.\nLee has been the city\u2019s chief secretary, one of the most senior officials in the government, since 2021. The 64-year-old, who started his career in the police force, oversaw the crackdown on 2019 anti-government protests.\nLee was sanctioned in 2020 by the U.S. Department of the Treasury for his role in implementing a national security law that has been used to crack down on dissent and for his role in \u201ccoercing, arresting, detaining, or imprisoning individuals\u201d under the legislation. Lee said he \u201cscoffed at the so-called sanctions\u201d and has referred to the U.S. as a bully.\nIn a May meeting with Lee in Beijing, Xi described Lee as \u201cresolute, daring to take responsibility and proactive.\u201d\nSteve Tsang, director of SOAS China Institute at the University of London, tells TIME that Lee\u2019s police background implies that he is \u201cused to following and giving orders.\u201d\nRead More: A Brief History of Protest in Post-Handover Hong Kong\nIn April, Lee said that one of his priorities is to enact a local security law\u2014in additional to the Beijing-imposed national security law that was put in place in 2020\u2014to prohibit acts of treason, secession, sedition or subversion against the central government.\nThe incoming chief executive has also said he\u2019ll try to integrate Hong Kong\u2019s economy with neighboring Guangdong province as part of the Greater Bay Area plan, and deal with inequality and housing issues.\nLee will also seek to repair Hong Kong\u2019s standing as a global financial hub. He has said he\u2019s already working on a strategy to reopen the border, but it remains unclear if the government will make quick or meaningful changes to the 7-day hotel quarantine currently required for incoming travelers, which has frustrated businesses in the city.\nBeijing has clearly laid out its expectations for Lee. The State Council\u2019s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, China\u2019s main body for Hong Kong affairs, issued a statement in June setting out goals for the new administration. It called for the new government to ensure Hong Kong\u2019s integration in the mainland\u2019s development, to deal with housing issues and inequality and to bolster its international competitiveness.\nWhen Britain handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997, Hong Kong was guaranteed \u201ca high degree of autonomy\u201d for a period of 50 years under a political model dubbed One Country, Two Systems. That afforded the city plenty of leeway to run its own affairs, including an independent judiciary and freedoms of assembly, the press and speech.\nOne of Beijing\u2019s goals for Lee is to correctly implement the One Country, Two Systems framework. Tsang, of SOAS, says that prior to the 2019 protests, Hong Kong was treated as a special administrative region in its own right, with the Hong Kong people and the rest of the world taking one interpretation of the One Country, Two Systems framework and a high degree of autonomy. Though Beijing had different views, it tolerated but did not necessarily accept a freewheeling Hong Kong. Following the protests, Tsang says that Beijing will only accept its own interpretation of those terms. Already many of the freedoms in Hong Kong have been impacted by a crackdown following the protests, and Beijing has taken a more active role in managing Hong Kong affairs. Lee was picked by Beijing to implement Beijing\u2019s version, he says. Lee \u201cmust have accepted that this is what he will have to do or he must be willing to do so.\u201d\n\u201cThis makes [Lee] different from all previous chief executives of Hong Kong, who were in principle responsible to both Beijing and to the people of Hong Kong and tried to varying degrees to maintain some pretense of a balance,\u201d says Tsang. \u201cThe old Hong Kong ended in Lam\u2019s watch and a new Hong Kong is likely to be fully established under Lee, and it will be one that resembles more of the Mainland, though not made into an extension of Shenzhen.\u201d", "translation": "", "uid": "02_00_207", "input": "by Chinese President Xi Jinping swear he in. anti - government protests roil the city. a major reform allow only \u201c patriots \u201d to run the city. by the U.S. Department of the Treasury sanction Lee for his role in implementing a national security law that has been used to crack down on dissent and for his role in \u201c coercing, arresting, detaining, or imprisoning individuals \u201d under the legislation.

Protesters fought back with catapults, Molotov cocktails and bows and arrows. \nPolice said they were conducting a dispersal and arrest operation, accusing those inside of rioting, a charge that can mean up to 10 years in jail. \nDozens staged daring escapes. \"We saw kids trying to escape by crawling through the sewage tunnels, protesters propelling from a bridge down to a highway where motorbikes were waiting for them,\" says Ms Chor, one of several journalists camped inside the campus alongside protesters to document the siege. \nEventually more than 1,000 mostly-young activists were arrested, as they attempted to flee or surrendered. When they left the campus in ambulances, some wrapped in emergency blankets, Ms Chor says it brought home just how young some of the protesters were, their parents waiting outside after pleading with police to keep them safe.\n\"It kind of revealed how this narrative of these clashes between equal parties is just not true,\" she said.\n.", "translation": "", "uid": "02_00_86", "input": "a mob of masked men at Yuen Long subway station, mostly wearing white and brandishing metal rods attack protesters returning home from a peaceful rally.

Are police in Hong Kong genuinely stifling protests? And if so, why do some peaceful marches like we have seen today proceed without incident? The answer is that in general law, there is a distinguishable difference between a lawful, peaceful protest which is approved by the police (like in all other countries) and what is otherwise defined as a \"riot\", which is unlawful.\n\nThis subtle yet significant distinction is not being covered in the narrative of events in Hong Kong.

"translation": "Secretary for Security Tang Bingqiang also said on the 30th that during the past 118 days of interrogation, it was clear to everyone that the purpose of these people was not to serve Hong Kong as members of the parliament after running for election, but to paralyze the government. This will inevitably lead to political instability in Hong Kong, leading to a constitutional crisis in Hong Kong and the shutdown of the SAR government, which will impact and greatly damage society, the economy, and people's livelihood. This damage is catastrophic.\nTang Bingqiang criticized them for planning to bring society to a standstill through large-scale street riots and other means, in order to achieve personal political goals and ignore the life and death of Hong Kong citizens. What they did was basically betraying Hong Kong people, which was extremely ugly, ugly and vicious. They used illegal means to seriously interfere with, obstruct and undermine the Hong Kong SAR government's performance of its duties and functions in accordance with the law.\nDeng Bingqiang also emphasized that it was seen from the interrogation that anyone who wants to endanger national security will not escape justice. The \"Maintenance of National Security Ordinance\" has come into effect, making the SAR more capable of safeguarding national security. However, we cannot take it lightly. External forces and their agents in Hong Kong are always watching and want to endanger our security. Throughout the trial, external forces continued to smear the judiciary, the Department of Justice, and law enforcement agencies, and also called for \"sanctions\" on those who performed their duties in an attempt to interfere with the independent trial and influence the court's decision.\nChief Superintendent of the National Security Department of the Hong Kong Police, Li Guihua, said on the 30th that the defendants had different levels of participation and roles, and they were lawless and defied the law. This time the court convicted them beyond reasonable doubt. The stern verdict was a wake-up call for them, letting them know that what they did at that time was wrong and illegal.\nHe pointed out that today, more than three years later, Hong Kong is relatively calm. But if we had not made a decisive decision at that time and completely pulled out these people, Hong Kong might have embarked on what they said at the time was the \"Ten Steps to Speculation\". As a result, there would continue to be many demonstrations and society would continue to come to a standstill. \"Let me ask everyone if they want to have this kind of life.\" ?\u201d\nIn addition, in response to some Western countries making irresponsible remarks on the results of this ruling, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said on the 30th that Hong Kong is a society governed by the rule of law. It is a basic principle that laws must be followed and violations must be investigated. No one can pretend to be \"democracy\". \"engage in illegal activities and attempt to escape legal sanctions.\nMao Ning said that the central government firmly supports the Hong Kong SAR's law enforcement and judicial agencies in fulfilling their duties in accordance with the law and punishing various behaviors that endanger national security. It firmly opposes individual countries using relevant judicial cases to interfere in China's internal affairs, smear and undermine the rule of law in Hong Kong.", "uid": "02_06_57", "input": "these people paralyze the government. them bring society to a standstill.

Revoking the law altogether is more difficult to do; the best we can expect is that they might put the law aside and not actually enforce it. So we'll see how they enforce the law. International pressure and the continuous resistance might change the calculation of the ruling elite in China. One test case will be the upcoming September legislative council election in Hong Kong. Usually in this election, people have all kinds of platforms, all kinds of slogans, and all kinds of things to say in the election forums. Whether the Hong Kong government will disqualify candidates or even arrest candidates for their election platform or for their speech and their posters and slogans will be a major testing case of how serious they are going to enforce the law.\nIt is too soon to tell. Many activists are already saying that they disbanded their organizations deemed subversive but they will continue to participate as an individual. People will find new, creative ways to evade the law and continue to fight on, but in what form, that we don't know yet. It will be a kind of a tug of war between the government and the people, so it is going to evolve.\nIt is always a challenge.

Blocking roads by dropping hefty objects upon them from overpasses; shooting ball bearings and arrows at the police officers on duty; even attacking the police with knives, slingshots, machetes, metal and wooden clubs \u2014 all these actions were seen often during those months of violent street protests in Hong Kong.\n\nThankfully, for the moment at least, such regular street battles seem to have died down in Hong Kong \u2014 no doubt thanks to the real danger of contracting COVID-19 when congregating in close quarters during protest and the less tolerant stance adopted by the Hong Kong Police Force following the adoption of the National Security Law.\n\nSo, while it matters little if foreign protesters choose to copy the Hong Kong protesters by going out attired completely in black, or blue or yellow costumes with the paraphernalia for that matter, it is just as well that the protesting youngsters in Thailand are for the most part non-violent in nature. Thankfully, they have not widely emulated that viciousness of inter-personal violence, or vandalizing of private and public property, so often seen in Hong Kong in the second half of last year. Nor have we seen in Thailand much of that deliberate disrespect to national symbols, such as flags, which became a common sight on Hong Kong\u2019s beleaguered streets. Clearly this is something Hong Kong protesters can learn from their Thai counterparts.\n\nThe Thai people have the well-founded reputation of being a gracious people, not disposed to using violence against each other. But that seems to be on the verge of changing, after the most recent street protests in Bangkok.

It is an approach that may be a direct response to the government\u2019s crackdown on the Umbrella Movement\u2019s leaders, several of whom were arrested and served prison terms.\nThe mainland and Hong Kong governments have called the protesters who stormed the Legislative Council \u201cextreme radicals.\u201d Some residents have questioned that group\u2019s approach, but many pro-democracy lawmakers and groups have said they understood that frustration with the government\u2019s response drove the protesters to adopt more forceful tactics.\n\u201cEverybody is understanding and sympathizing,\u201d said Bonnie Leung, spokeswoman for the Civil Human Rights Front. \u201cSome may condemn the violence, but they condemn the government more because they are the root cause.\u201d\nIn the movement this year, decisions on when, where and how to protest have often been made collectively and anonymously on the spot, or on social media platforms where users are anonymous and details are worked out through likes and so-called upvotes.\nThe movement uses LIHKG, an online forum similar to Reddit, where users post calls to action, and the most popular ones get pushed to the top of the forum.\nProtesters have also become more agile and mobile by using Telegram, an encrypted messaging platform, to create public channels to share information and smaller private groups to quickly organize actions.\nEric Siu, one of the participants at the G-20 protests on June 26, described how users create discussion threads on LIHKG and provide suggestions. \u201cThen people will give responses or click push to make that specific thread a hot one,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can predict what\u2019s going to happen by which posts are the hottest.\u201d\nThis tactic has also allowed protesters to move quickly from location to location, sometimes without much advance planning. Benny Yap, a car dealership owner, has been voluntarily delivering supplies to protesters and figures out where they are by checking the LIHKG forum.

In Hong Kong, this has meant the Basic Law, which the Standing Committee has interpreted five times. The last time it did so was in 2016, to dictate the decision in an ongoing court case in Hong Kong involving two pro-independence members of the Legislative Council, leading to their disqualification from office.\n\nIn addition to the Basic Law, the National Security Law, as a national law, is also subject to interpretation by the Standing Committee. The new law further states that it supersedes all Hong Kong local laws, including the Bill of Rights Ordinance (art. 62). It is unclear, however, whether the security law supersedes the Basic Law as well, a question raised by the Hong Kong Bar Association, which the Hong Kong government has not clarified.\n\nAs a result, Hong Kong courts will have little ability to limit the reach of the security law when it conflicts with these laws, including those that guarantee human rights protections. Any judges who do so risk having the Standing Committee intervene to interpret the law. The new law, therefore, severely undermines the independence of Hong Kong\u2019s judiciary.\n\nExtra Territoriality\n\nThe National Security Law states that it applies beyond Hong Kong and China (arts. 37, 38). Under the law, anyone who criticizes the Hong Kong or Chinese governments anywhere in the world can potentially be charged with violating the security law, putting them at risk if they visit Hong Kong, or if their own governments agree to extradite them to Hong Kong.", "translation": "", "uid": "02_00_69", "input": "who provoke hatred against the Chinese or Hong Kong governments.

It has to be condemned in the strongest terms possible by all law-abiding citizens and objective observers, in particular by all who love Hong Kong - whatever their political persuasion. There is no place for violence, for riotous behavior, for the destruction of property, in the arena for the settling of political differences. The Hong Kong police must be commended for the forbearance it has displayed in handling a most difficult situation.\n\nI received this message from a friend, who said: \"I just ran into a Singaporean friend who just came back from Hong Kong last week At MTR stations people were giving away T-shirts, goggles, masks and chemicals to wash away tear gas. He said he sells goggles and these were top-of-the-line unbreakable goggles and the masks were 3M. It will cost millions to supply so many people. At the protests, there were people giving directions where to go, etc. Very well-organized.\"\n\nPictures in the press on Tuesday certainly showed that most people among the mob trashing the Legislative Council building were wearing protective gear confirming what my Singaporean friend had seen at MTR stations. The obvious conclusion is that outside powers are hijacking public sentiment by instigating violence. I am not going to speculate what outside powers are involved, but suffice to say, it is not for the betterment of Hong Kong. The organizer(s) could be anyone with money.\n\nThere is this other message I read in a Hong Kong newspaper, sent by a \"14-year-old student, on Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor and her government\" - \"We have been demonstrating peacefully, but do you know how disappointing it is to have a record rally turnout and yet the government refuses to reply? We are not rioters. We just don't want to sit and wait for doomsday, so we have resorted to this.\" Notice the use of the word \"doomsday\". Why would a 14-year-old use that word?

Secretary for Justice Yuen Kwok-keung condemned the violence that occurred at the Legislative Council building in the early morning. The Hong Kong government even condemned \"thug behavior\" in a statement, saying that Hong Kong citizens must abide by the law when expressing their opinions or demands and \"violence will never be tolerated.\"\n\n\"Taiwan's Sunflower Student Movement also attacked the Legislative Yuan, why can't Hong Kong people attack?\" Hong Kong's \"Ming Pao\" said that on the night of the 18th, dozens of demonstrators wearing masks began to attack the Hong Kong Legislative Council building shouting such slogans. The incident described by the newspaper was roughly as follows: At about 10 o'clock that night, a group of demonstrators who called themselves \"netizens\" gathered in the demonstration area near the Legislative Council, and then tried to break into the Legislative Council for the first time, but failed. Legislative Council security immediately blocked all exits of the Legislative Council. The attackers claimed that the purpose of the operation was to prevent parliamentarians from entering and exiting normally, in response to the court's injunction order to clear the CITIC Building in Admiralty during the day. At 11:04 in the night, the demonstrators launched a second wave of attacks. This time they claimed that the purpose of the action was to prevent the Legislative Council from reviewing the Internet copyright-related legislation they called \"Internet 23\" on the 19th. However, this round of attacks was lighter. At 11:40 in the evening, a group of \"netizens\" wearing masks tried to rush to the main podium in the Admiralty occupied area, calling on everyone to storm the Legislative Council, and had an argument with the \"Occupy Central\" picket team.

"translation": "One of the root causes of riots in Hong Kong\nThe full name of the \"Civil Front for Human Rights\" is the \"Civil Human Rights Front\". It was established in September 2002. It claims to be \"a joint platform focusing on political and democratic issues\". In fact, it is a \"campaign for speculation\". Almost all opposition members participate in it. At its peak, more than 60 organizations joined.\nThe original intention of the establishment of the Democratic Front was to carry out legislative work on Article 23 of the Basic Law. In September 2002, the Hong Kong Security Bureau issued the \"Consultation Document on the Implementation of Article 23 of the Basic Law.\" In 2003, when the SARS epidemic subsided, the Democratic Front launched the \"July 1 Parade\" to oppose the legislation of Article 23, which caused the SAR government to In March, it was announced that the submission of the second reading of the draft would be postponed indefinitely. Since then, the \"Democratic Front\" has instigated the \"July 1 Parade\" every year, with the goal of \"one country, two systems\" and the administration of the SAR government. From 2004 to 2007, the \"Democratic Front\" continuously incited citizens to fight for the so-called \"double universal suffrage\", and the opposition began to use Achieving \"double universal suffrage\" as the ultimate goal of \"resistance to China\". In 2012, Yang Zhengxian, the former convener of the Democratic Front, together with Yan Wuzhou, the then vice-president of the Chinese University Student Union, and Joshua Wong, the former secretary-general of Demosisto Hong Kong, launched an \"anti-national education\" campaign, inciting the academic community to participate in a class strike and forcing the SAR government to The decision to establish a moral and national education department was eventually withdrawn. This has endless consequences for Hong Kong society. It is precisely because some students do not understand the history of mainland China and Hong Kong that they eventually embark on the path of illegal \"Occupy Central\" and inciting violence.\nAfter the \"July 1 Parade\" initiated by the \"Democratic Front\" ended in 2014, its members \"Students' Federation\" and \"Scholar People's Thought\" launched a sit-in activity in Central that night to \"rehearse Occupy Central\", which also became a 79-day long protest. The beginning of the illegal \"Occupy Central\" campaign. Since then, the Democratic Front has gone further and further down the path of so-called \"violent resistance.\" On June 9, 2019, the first large-scale demonstration that broke out in Hong Kong due to the \"anti-extradition bill amendment\" was initiated by the \"Democratic Front\". The demonstration later turned into a riot. Some thugs stormed the Legislative Council building and clashed with the police. Throughout the \"rebellion over the amendment bill\", the \"Democratic Front\" has always been a platform for \"soliciting speculation\" and black violence in Hong Kong. Almost every parade and rally launched has paved the way for black-clad thugs and \"Hong Kong independence\" elements, which eventually evolved into Massive riots.\nAfter the implementation of the National Security Law in Hong Kong last year, the \"Democratic Front\" still openly \"challenged\" and attempted to launch demonstrations and rallies on July 1 and October 1 last year. However, under the shock of the National Security Law, it was ultimately unable to cause trouble. However, this year's New Year's Day demonstration instigated by the Democratic Front once again saw black-clad thugs vandalizing, blocking roads, and setting fires everywhere. Many leaders of the organization were also charged with \"conspiracy to subvert state power\" for attempting to paralyze the governance of the SAR government. Among them, Au Noxuan served as the convener of the \"Democratic Front\" from October 2016 to October 2017, and Shun Zijie served as the convener of the Democratic Front in 2015. He served as the convener from October 2016 to October 2016 and from October 2018 to October 2020. Chen Haohuan, who succeeded Shum Zijie as the convener in October last year, once organized illegal gatherings in his \"personal capacity\" many times after the \"Democratic Front\" launched a demonstration and was opposed by the police, involving 4 cases and 14 crimes. Some Hong Kong media bluntly stated that facts have repeatedly proven that the \"Democratic Front\" is not a platform for Hong Kong citizens to express their opinions at all, but an evil political organization that promotes violence. It is not only responsible for the Hong Kong riots, but also creates violent conflicts one after another. One of the root causes of the destruction of the rule of law and social unrest in Hong Kong.", "uid": "02_06_41", "input": "Almost all opposition members participate in it. the Hong Kong Security Bureau issue the \" Consultation Document on the Implementation of Article 23 of the Basic Law. the \" Democratic Front \" instigate the \" July 1 Parade \". the \" Democratic Front \" incite citizens to fight for the so - called \" double universal suffrage \". the opposition use Achieving \" double universal suffrage \" as the ultimate goal of \" resistance to China \".
