What's even more coincidental is that many co-authors are also \"contributors\" to this paper on Hong Kong.\nAfter looking at his social media accounts, I discovered more.\nIn a tweet on June 15, 2019, he mentioned an article published by the team on the London School of Political Science website two years ago, which stated that the mainland has a so-called \"triple dilemma\" in Hong Kong, and that protests are detrimental to maintaining Hong Kong's political stability is \"vital\".\nIs doing things in Hong Kong conducive to Hong Kong's stability? Isn\u2019t this similar to Pelosi\u2019s \u201cbeautiful landscape\u201d?\nThe article, which Yang co-wrote, claimed: \"As long as the people of Hong Kong threaten credible protests, Beijing can be restrained.\"\nThe use of protests to force the passage of Article 23 of the Basic Law was called a \"successful case\" by the paper, and in the author's eloquent article on the LSE website, there is even this statement: \"Article 23 of the Basic Law Doing nothing is important to Hong Kong's stability and \"one country, two systems.\" Protests are a source of stability, not instability. Beijing's attempts to pass national security legislation within the framework of Article 23 of the Basic Law are actually a source of instability. \"\nTranslate: Obstructing the legislation under Article 23 is a matter of abiding by the Basic Law and safeguarding \"one country, two systems\"; establishing national security legislation based on Article 23 is illegal and is not conducive to the stability of Hong Kong.\nWhat is even more obvious is that the views of several authors of the paper were also included in the article on the LSE website. They interviewed thousands of students who participated in the \"Occupy Central\" movement, and based on the survey results of 1,500 of them, The so-called \"evidence\" that young people in Hong Kong have become radicalized was obtained: 88% of people consider themselves Hong Kongers rather than Chinese; 22% support the use of violence to pursue political rights in Hong Kong. And when they \"encouraged\" students to express anonymously, the proportion of those who supported violence reached 40%.\nThe LSE official website also stated that \"this article represents the views of the author of the paper and has nothing to do with LSE.\"\nDavid Yang called the South China Morning Post's 2017 report on gang violence on the streets of Hong Kong a \"Nice report\".\nOn the day when the black riots broke out in Hong Kong in 2019, he retweeted articles from accounts supporting the riots and \"praised\": \"Collective action is the most spectacular scene showing human power.\"\nFrom 2017 to 2018, David Yang was also one of the main disseminators of Xinjiang-related rumors. He also reposted social media tweets from the famous lie maker Adrian Zenz. This has to make people wonder, how many Zheng Guoen and others are there in Western university circles?

According to reports, Hong Kong's radical opposition organizations \"Scholar Citizen Thought\" and the Federation of Students rehearsed \"Occupy Central\" on the evening of July 1, illegally trying to force the Hong Kong SAR government to accept \"citizen nominations\" that were not in compliance with the Basic Law. People from all walks of life in Hong Kong pointed out that the opposition first used the illegal \"referendum\" to build momentum, and then illegally \"Occupy Central\". They were kidnapping public opinion in order to challenge \"one country, two systems\", ignore the mainstream public opinion in Hong Kong society, and harm the interests of Hong Kong's 7 million citizens.\n\nFamous person: \"Don't do anything illegal\"\n\nThe report also interviewed many Hong Kong people to express their views on the matter. Chen Yongqi, a member of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, told the People's Daily that he was young and opposed many things, but no one should do anything illegal. The so-called \"referendum\" launched by the \"Occupy Central\" group a few days ago \"can't see the actual number of people voting and whether the votes are duplicated, so there must be something wrong.\"\n\nCheng Yaotang, executive chairman of the Hong Kong Celebration Committee, told the People's Daily that the most important thing for citizens to express their demands is to abide by the law, and instigating violations of the law and causing trouble are not Hong Kong's core values. Tam Yiu-chung, chairman of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of China and member of the Legislative Council, pointed out that the voices from all walks of life against \"Occupy Central\" are very loud, and he does not understand why the opposition still goes against public opinion. \"Occupy Central\" is blatantly illegal. It not only blocks traffic, but also affects people's daily lives and poses a danger to people's lives and property. He was worried that the situation would eventually get out of control, and urged the opposition to think carefully and \"illegal things should not be done.\" Ip Kwok-him, convener of the DAB Legislative Council caucus, pointed out that everyone, including students, should not engage in illegal and violent behaviors. The police should act in accordance with the law.\n\nThe numbers are false and there is a black hand behind it.\n\nThe People's Daily stated that the \"Democratic Front\", which launched the \"July 1\" march in Hong Kong, claimed that the number of people marching this year was more than five times that announced by the police. This shows that the \"Democratic Front\" is crazy about counting (big numbers). The newspaper cited an article by Wen Pingli published by Hong Kong's Wen Wei Po and pointed out that in fact, the police used a scientific and rigorous statistical method to count the number of people in the march, which was well-founded. The opposition insists that this is nothing more than a \"self-fulfilling lie\", telling and directing its own lies. Who else would believe such numbers?\n\nFollow-up: More than 500 demonstrators in Hong Kong have been released\n\nAccording to the People's Daily, the Hong Kong police have released more than 500 arrested demonstrators. The police issued warning notices to 486 people who participated in the \"July 1 Parade\", and 25 others were granted bail pending investigation and reported to the police from late July to early August. The police said that three arrested men aged 18 to 68 were found with screwdrivers, knives or folding knives on their bodies and were arrested on suspicion of \"possession of offensive weapons\", while another 21-year-old woman was arrested on suspicion of \"assaulting a police officer\" .", "uid": "02_06_38", "input": "", "char_offset": "0-940"}

Not only the arrested persons were involved, but also a large-scale illegal assembly of more than 100 people. They were \"complicit in committing the crime\" and \"a collective action\".

It played the card of tragedy, created an image of being forced to disband, and concealed the fact that it was abandoned.\nThe Democratic Front was first abandoned by the times. Today, when the international situation is undergoing profound and complex changes, Hong Kong, as a special administrative region of the country, must of course stand with the country to safeguard national security and defend national interests in a complex multilateral international environment. Especially after the central government took the initiative to fill Hong Kong's legal loopholes in maintaining national security in 2020 in response to the international situation and the situation in Hong Kong, maintaining national security has become an important issue in Hong Kong. Of course, the \"Han\" organization will only end up being abandoned by the times.\nSecondly, the Democratic Front was abandoned by its former fellow travelers. As early as early March this year, after news spread that the Democratic Front might be banned according to law, its members cut their seats one after another and announced that they would terminate their participation in the work of the Democratic Front. The \"Democratic Front\" groups quickly shrunk from 48 to less than 10 before disbandment, leaving behind the radical political group and its satellite organizations of the last two conveners. Members are jumping ship one after another. Is it because the world is so cold and they throw it away after use, or are they cutting off their robes and severing their righteousness to protect themselves wisely? On the bright side, these pan-democratic groups participating in the \"Democratic Front\" also have legal concepts. Faced with possible legal liabilities, of course they choose to cut themselves off to protect themselves. When the members dispersed, the platform of the \"Democratic Front\" naturally collapsed.\nIn the end, the \"Democratic Front\" was abandoned by the Hong Kong people. As the initiator, leader, and operator of the \"July 1 Parade\" and the \"Amendment Movement\" demonstrations in Hong Kong for many years, the \"Democratic Front\" is well aware of whether these demonstrations have brought a good reputation or a bad influence to Hong Kong. After experiencing a series of incidents such as the \"revision storm\", the disbandment of \"Hong Kong independence\" organizations after the promulgation of the Hong Kong National Security Law, the imprisonment of \"Hong Kong independence\" elements, and the flight of others, many Hong Kong people have seen more To make it clear: what kind of organization and what kind of behavior are really good for Hong Kong, and what kind of organization and what kind of behavior are specifically bringing chaos to Hong Kong. Now that Hong Kong people have seen clearly, the disbandment of the Democratic Front is the inevitable result of the development of Hong Kong's social situation.", "uid": "02_06_44", "input": "", "char_offset": "0-701"}

Tomorrow is July 1, and the opposition calls on Hong Kong citizens who have voted to participate in the \"July 1\" demonstrations to continue to put pressure on the central government.\n\nSuch demonstrations are legal in Hong Kong, but from holding a \"referendum\" to organizing the \"July 1 Parade\" to planning the large-scale \"Occupy Central\" action, all of this has continued to portray and accumulate the \"political power\" of the radical opposition.

From the perspective of the national constitution, this is a serious misalignment.\n\nThe white paper issued by the central government not long ago clearly requires that the candidate for chief executive must be selected from people who \"patriotize and love Hong Kong.\" The radical opposition rejected this condition, which implicitly requires that people who are hostile to the central government can also run for election. If the central government makes concessions to them, Hong Kong's future will face huge uncertainty.\n\nThe radical opposition in Hong Kong probably knows that their request is impossible to achieve, and they seem to be treating the current series of actions as a mobilization process for the \"opposition\" of Hong Kong society. Officials and scholars in Hong Kong and the Mainland have repeatedly called for the need to avoid confrontation between Mainland society and Hong Kong society. In fact, there is no organizational force in the Mainland to promote confrontation with Hong Kong society. When Mainland public opinion rebounds against the radical opposition in Hong Kong, it also All have this consciousness.\n\nHowever, Hong Kong's radical opposition seems to be trying every possible means to build a \"chariot\" to trick as many Hong Kong citizens into boarding this vehicle.

The relevant public gatherings and processions are not exempted from the \"Restriction on Gathering Order\" group gatherings. Holding or participating in rallies and processions is illegal and will disrupt public order. . The police have reason to believe that holding relevant activities will increase the risk of virus infection among participants and other citizens, and will pose a major threat to the lives and health of all citizens.\nThe police also stated that given that the social atmosphere has remained unstable recently, after careful assessment, there is reason to believe that some participants in this rally and procession may deviate from the original route and violently damage nearby high-risk buildings, including MTR stations, Police Headquarters and Government Headquarters.

According to the website of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government, Hong Kong \"Occupy Action\" demonstrators attacked the Hong Kong Legislative Council building in the early morning of the 19th, causing damage to many parts of the building. Police have arrested six people and strongly condemned acts that disrupted public order. \n\nHong Kong government sources said that the incident occurred at 1 a.m., and demonstrators used iron horses (obstacles) and bricks to violently attack the building many times. Many glass doors in the building were shattered and brick walls were pried off. The police arrived at the scene to assist at the request of the Legislative Council.\n\nThe demonstrators also attempted to prevent the police from enforcing the law. The demonstrators ignored the advice and warnings, so the police used minimum force to stop the attack, including using pepper spray to prevent the demonstrators from continuing to attack and defend themselves against attacks. Three police officers were injured in the incident. \n\nThe police reiterated that Hong Kong society agrees that demands should be expressed in a rational and peaceful manner and that behaviors that undermine public order and public safety will never be tolerated.\n\nThe Special Administrative Region Government strongly condemned the actions of thugs who stormed the Legislative Council building on the 19th, emphasizing that citizens must abide by the law when expressing their opinions or demands and will never tolerate violence. \n\nAs a result, the Public Works Subcommittee meeting and the Legislative Council meeting originally scheduled to be held on the morning of the 19th were forced to be rescheduled, and the operations of the Parliament were further delayed.\n\nYuen Kwok-keung, the Secretary for Justice of the SAR Government, emphasized that the police and the Department of Justice will handle matters in accordance with laws and established procedures. He reiterated that illegal or unlawful acts will not be allowed to undermine the rule of law. If there is sufficient evidence, law enforcement will be strictly enforced. He does not want to release the idea that \"people who commit illegal acts can get away with it.\" \u201d information, which is also the basic requirement and practice of the rule of law.\n\nYuen Guoqiang said that he believed that the vast majority of Hong Kong people did not want to see violent incidents or express their demands in a violent way, and called on the occupying people or other demonstrators not to express their demands in a violent way.", "uid": "02_06_100", "input": "", "char_offset": "0-555"}

The number of people was said to be more than in previous years, but there is a big gap between the statistics of various parties. The opposition is happy and considers this year's march and the previous \"referendum\" to be their \"victory\" by adding pressure on the central government. Two Hong Kong student organizations staged an \"Occupy Central\" event in advance last night, claiming that they would wait until Hong Kong Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying went to work this morning and demand dialogue with him. Their plan challenged Hong Kong's laws and constituted a test of the Hong Kong government's handling capabilities.\n\nThe July 1st March has become a new \"protest political tradition\" in Hong Kong. Its core organizer is the Hong Kong opposition, but the actual participants and their demands are becoming more and more diverse. \"Democracy activists\" and gay supporters who have fled from the mainland will use the July 1st parade to show their presence. There are also many people who just express their \"dissatisfaction\" or just want to join in the fun, treating the parade as a party and carnival to relieve stress and jointly create a grand impression.\n\nThe opposition is very concerned about the number of people attending the July 1st demonstrations, and the numbers they publish every time are higher than the actual statistics of the police. When watching the July 1st Parade in Hong Kong from the mainland, you must have a relieved attitude. The number of people marching to a certain extent reflects the sentiment of Hong Kong society, but the relationship between the two is not equal. Public opinion in Hong Kong is complex, and rational fundamentals have always existed. The opposition wants to influence policy formulation through street actions, which should never be encouraged.\n\nIn the coming period, the Hong Kong opposition will intensify various protests and even \"disobedience\" activities to strive for the central government to make concessions that break through the Basic Law around Hong Kong's political reform. It is difficult for ordinary citizens in Hong Kong to fully understand the Basic Law. The opposition's use of \"Hong Kong democracy is under threat\" to scare everyone can cater to the concerns of many ordinary people, thereby drawing them into protests and building momentum against the central government.", "uid": "02_06_17", "input": "", "char_offset": "0-596"}

During the incident, the police arrested four men aged 18 to 24 on suspicion of criminal damage and assaulting police officers. Three male police officers were injured and sent to hospital for treatment.\n\n    At around 1 a.m. this morning, demonstrators stormed the Legislative Council building, causing damage to many parts of the building.

Because an academic paper has strict requirements on method and data sources and must undergo anonymous review, the accuracy of the facts disclosed in this academic paper is no less accurate than a news report, or even more accurate than a news report.\nFrom this, we can see how the West is deeply involved in social movements in other countries and regions and provokes social unrest in other countries. In the form of an academic paper, the author describes the United States' instigation, instigation, and participation in organizing social movements in other countries and regions. A more accurate description. Three points can be seen:\nFirst, the violent social movements in Hong Kong and many other places have foreign masterminds.\nSecond, the United States and the West are organized, premeditated, methodological, funded, and involved in inciting color revolution social violence in other places.\nThird, we can see that the distorted values \u200b\u200band morals of the United States and the West actually regard inciting riots in other countries as a glorious mission, and do so openly and openly, to the point of cognitive confusion, obsession, and pride instead of shame.\nLu Xiang, a researcher at the Institute of American Studies of the Academy of Social Sciences, told reporters that similar papers would not be allowed to be published if they were used for domestic political research in the United States. Because this article involves some data on society as a whole, it falls under the category of national security and should be subject to strict laws and regulations.\nObviously, there will be various dissatisfactions in any society, but no country will allow such dissatisfaction to turn into political riots. Such a paper, to put it bluntly, provides a social psychological basis for organizing political protests in disguise.\nThe publication of such articles shows that the United States only cares about its own stability, completely ignores the stability of other countries and regions, and even hopes that some target countries will be unstable. The United States has a long tradition of engaging in \"color revolutions\" abroad, and has a complete set of methods to guide them. Under the guidance of this method, various sporadic dissatisfactions in society can easily aggregate into political and thematic dissatisfaction. Lu Xiang calls it \"horizontal\" mobilization, which gathers dissatisfaction from all corners under one banner.\nOn the other hand, this paper also reflects that before the introduction of the Hong Kong National Security Law, Hong Kong society had a serious lack of security for a long period of time.

He stormed the Legislative Council with Yau Wai-chen and three other people. He was charged with participating in illegal assembly and was sentenced to four weeks in prison in 2018. He was later released on bail pending appeal.\nAccording to Hong Kong's \"Eastern Net\" news, today (September 2), the Hong Kong High Court rejected Liang Songheng's appeal, and he must be imprisoned immediately to serve his sentence. The judge believed that the conviction was not unsafe and the sentence was not obviously excessive, so he dismissed his appeal application.\nIn 2016, then-Legislative Council members Leung Chung-hang and Yau Wai-chen displayed \"Hong Kong Independence\" slogans and altered their oaths while taking the oath, and were ruled to have lost their qualifications as members. The two are both members of the \"Youth New Deal\", a \"Hong Kong independence\" organization.\nOn November 2 of the same year, he, together with You Huizhen and three assistants, forced their way into the Legislative Council conference room. Leung Chung-hang and Yau Wai-ching were charged with using \"extreme force\" to enter the Legislative Council conference room on the day of the incident, and were involved in the crime of participating in an illegal assembly.\nIn May 2018, Hong Kong's Kowloon City Magistrates' Court convicted Leung Chung-hang and sentenced him to four weeks in prison. Subsequently, Liang Songheng was granted bail and appealed to the Hong Kong High Court, requesting to overturn the conviction and apply for a commutation of sentence. In June this year, the Court of First Instance of the Hong Kong High Court opened a hearing on the case.\nOn September 2, the court officially rejected Liang Songheng\u2019s appeal application, and he was therefore required to serve his sentence in prison immediately. Judge Chan Ka-Shing of the Court of First Instance believed that the conviction by the Kowloon City Magistrates' Court was not unsafe and the sentence was not obviously excessive, so he dismissed his appeal application.\nBarrister Kenneth Kwok, who represents Leung Chung-heng, said he plans to appeal to the Court of Final Appeal.\nIt is worth mentioning that when Leung Chung-hang and Yau Wai-chen were ruled to have lost their membership qualifications in 2016, they had only been in office for 12 days, but they had already received one month's parliamentary salary of about HK$90,000 each, and more than HK$830,000 in advance operating funds.\nThe Administrative Committee of the Hong Kong Legislative Council (AC) filed with the District Court in 2017 and 2018 to recover the above-mentioned amounts from the two people. In May 2020, the Hong Kong court ruled that the two must return a total of approximately NT$1.86 million in salary and advances to the ACAC, and pay the ACAC\u2019s legal fees.\nYou Huizhen's proposal to repay in installments was accepted. She will repay HK$25,000 per month in 48 installments. Liang Songheng still ignored it. On August 18, the Administration Commission filed a petition with the Hong Kong High Court to make Leung Chung Hang bankrupt. \"Eastern Net\" quoted the Legislative Council Secretariat as saying that this is the first time that the ACCM has submitted a bankruptcy petition to an individual.", "uid": "02_06_62", "input": "", "char_offset": "0-768"}

The Hong Kong SAR government, members of the Legislative Council, and various political groups have condemned the rioters' actions. The police launched a comprehensive investigation and people were arrested one after another.\n\nInformation provided by the police shows that the 11 people arrested so far, ranging in age from 17 to 54, were suspected of \"criminal damage\", \"assaulting a police officer\", \"accessing computers with criminal or dishonest intent\", and \"illegal assembly\" \".

In addition, the organizers of the action and some politicians who supported the action distorted the concept of the rule of law and spread the fallacy that there is no need to abide by the law.

Soon, members of many groups withdrew from the \"Democratic Front\" one after another, including street workers, the Association for Democracy, the Civic Party, the Democratic Party, etc.\n\nHong Kong Police Commissioner Xiao Zeyi said on the 12th that he would investigate whether the \"Democratic Front\" is suspected of violating Hong Kong's national security law. He revealed that the police have been collecting evidence and will take action against illegal organizations in accordance with the law at any time. He emphasized that offenders should not think that they can \"escape\" by disbanding.", "uid": "02_06_20", "input": "", "char_offset": "0-744"}

Subsequently, the personal and family information of some police officers was made public on the Internet, including the names, ID numbers and families of the police officers and their family members. Address, etc.\nSome police officers said that they and their families received a large number of harassing and threatening calls and text messages. According to statistics, 150 cases were transferred to the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data in a short period of time.\nAmid the turmoil over the amendment bill, some online forums and social media in Hong Kong have become breeding grounds for thugs and classrooms for inciting atrocities, becoming the biggest source of chaos in Hong Kong. Faced with Hong Kong teenagers who have grown up with the Internet and are deeply dependent on it, as long as they seize the right to speak online through various means, constantly cater to their interests and preferences, and stimulate their extremes and hatred, they can trap their hearts and incite them. They roam the streets.\nA survey by the Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups found that nearly 90% of Hong Kong youth own smartphones and use them for an average of 3.5 hours a day. Social media represented by Facebook has become the most commonly used platform by Hong Kong youth, and nearly half of Hong Kong youth use it as the main source of information on public affairs.\nOn social platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube in Hong Kong, rumors are costless and lies are flying everywhere. \"Police sexually assaulted an arrested woman\", \"Police undercover threw incendiary bombs\", \"People died at Prince Edward Station on August 31\"... Internet rumors pushed some young people who did not know what was going on into an inexplicable \"revenge\" mood and lost their rational thinking. and independent judgment. Even if the police and relevant departments provide evidence to prove that the online rumors are completely false, the inciters continue to spread the rumors online and conduct \"memorial\" activities online and offline.\nMalicious subversion and arrogance are the most common means to incite violence and inspire hatred and fear. In August, some maliciously modified pictures and videos were circulated online. An image shows a family being chased by riot police at New Town Plaza in Sha Tin. The video played by the police at the press conference clearly showed that the police were escorting them to a safe place. The family later publicly thanked the police for protecting them.\nIn a video of the demonstration played by the police, a young man suddenly jumped off the bridge, and multiple police officers caught him in time to avoid a tragedy. However, the incident was described online as \"the police pushing the young man off the bridge\".\nViolent instigation is not considered strange on the Internet, and it has even turned into violent and terrorist teaching with a terrorist nature. Social media represented by the \"Lian Deng\" online discussion forum and \"Telegram\" have become the source and command post of \"black terror\" and the base camp for instigating atrocities.\nLog into these two online platforms and you will be flooded with inciting posts. Want to make your own assault weapon and use it correctly? There are graphic or video tutorials here to teach you \"step by step\" how to make and use incendiary bombs, smoke bombs, improvised bombs, and corrosive liquid bombs. In addition, there are \"dog sticks\", bows and arrows, modified slingshots... \"Eighteen kinds of weapons\" used by black-clad thugs when they attack police and siege institutions. You can find \"warfare instruction manuals\" here.\n\"The online public opinion environment in Hong Kong is particularly bad.\" Chen Zhihao, vice chairman of the Hong Kong Youth Current Affairs Commentators Association, felt deeply. \"The opposition is very comfortable on the popular Internet, and all kinds of rumors and slanderous things can be circulated unimpeded.\"", "uid": "02_06_49", "input": "", "char_offset": "0-1031"}

I think there is something wrong with Hong Kong's education.\"\nWhen Ali was interviewed by reporters at the Hong Kong Police Headquarters, the wound on his neck was clearly visible (photo taken on November 27, 2019). (Photo by Xinhua News Agency reporter Li Zhen)\nTeenagers are the most enthusiastic group in the turmoil over the extradition bill. They wantonly set fires and vandalism, smashed shops, destroyed public facilities, threw petrol bombs, and attacked police and citizens.\nBut what is ridiculous is that after some of them were punished by the police according to law, some schools not only did not criticize their illegal and violent behavior, but instead issued a statement accusing \"the police of violating regulations and exceeding their authority\" and calling on all walks of life to \"accept\" the violent students.\nThere are many teachers in Hong Kong who incite violence and commit violence. Huang Junyu, president of the Hong Kong Federation of Educators, said that there are more than 60,000 teachers in primary and secondary schools in Hong Kong, including some teachers with more radical ideas. Although they are small in number, they have great energy. They use the platform to carry out political propaganda and persuade some immature young people and even minors to take to the streets. The most violent members among them were trained to be \"brave\" men who did not distinguish right from wrong and despised the law.\nAccording to statistics from the education department of the Hong Kong SAR government, from June last year to the end of January this year, a total of 171 complaints were received about possible professional misconduct by teachers, most of which involved making inappropriate remarks such as hatred and curses. A middle school assistant principal actually cursed that \"a gangster policeman will kill his whole family\" and \"the policeman's children will not survive until the age of seven.\" Public opinion in Hong Kong called this a \"shame on the education sector.\"\nAs the largest single-industry trade union in Hong Kong and the organization with the largest number of participating members, the Hong Kong \"Teachers' Association\" has long been controlled by opposition forces. The leader of the organization, Ye Jianyuan, once expressed support for middle school students in promoting \"Hong Kong independence\" on campus, beautifying it as \"having independent opinions, having personal opinions and caring about current affairs.\"\n\u201cIf Hong Kong\u2019s education is \u2018sick\u2019, then there is something wrong with the educators first.\u201d Gu Minkang, former deputy dean of the School of Law of City University of Hong Kong, wrote in an article.\nIn addition to educators, there are also many problems with teaching content. \"Hong Kong lacks national education with positive guidance, but is full of negative expressions of the opposition and 'education' full of hatred.\" said Deng Fei, principal of Hong Kong Island Secondary School in Tseung Kwan O.", "uid": "02_06_47", "input": "", "char_offset": "0-825"}

If there are differences between the two, I think there are at least two differences:\nFirst, the thugs who attacked the Hong Kong Legislative Council in July 2019 smashed and vandalized the legislative body, hunted down innocent people, and attacked the police with petrol bombs and knives. Such crimes are more serious and more vicious than climbing on the outer wall of the Congress and storming into the Congress in the United States. They should be defined as \"thugs\" and \"terrorists\" and should be severely punished by law.\nSecond, what happened in the U.S. Congress was organized by the Americans themselves, while what happened in Hong Kong was instigated, planned, organized, directed and implemented by external forces, and some people in the United States played a very disgraceful role in it. .", "uid": "02_06_87", "input": "", "char_offset": "0-275"}
