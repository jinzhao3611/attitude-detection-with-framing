What's even more coincidental is that many co-authors are also \"contributors\" to this paper on Hong Kong.\nAfter looking at his social media accounts, I discovered more.\nIn a tweet on June 15, 2019, he mentioned an article published by the team on the London School of Political Science website two years ago, which stated that the mainland has a so-called \"triple dilemma\" in Hong Kong, and that protests are detrimental to maintaining Hong Kong's political stability is \"vital\".\nIs doing things in Hong Kong conducive to Hong Kong's stability? Isn\u2019t this similar to Pelosi\u2019s \u201cbeautiful landscape\u201d?\nThe article, which Yang co-wrote, claimed: \"As long as the people of Hong Kong threaten credible protests, Beijing can be restrained.\"\nThe use of protests to force the passage of Article 23 of the Basic Law was called a \"successful case\" by the paper, and in the author's eloquent article on the LSE website, there is even this statement: \"Article 23 of the Basic Law Doing nothing is important to Hong Kong's stability and \"one country, two systems.\" Protests are a source of stability, not instability. Beijing's attempts to pass national security legislation within the framework of Article 23 of the Basic Law are actually a source of instability. \"\nTranslate: Obstructing the legislation under Article 23 is a matter of abiding by the Basic Law and safeguarding \"one country, two systems\"; establishing national security legislation based on Article 23 is illegal and is not conducive to the stability of Hong Kong.\nWhat is even more obvious is that the views of several authors of the paper were also included in the article on the LSE website. They interviewed thousands of students who participated in the \"Occupy Central\" movement, and based on the survey results of 1,500 of them, The so-called \"evidence\" that young people in Hong Kong have become radicalized was obtained: 88% of people consider themselves Hong Kongers rather than Chinese; 22% support the use of violence to pursue political rights in Hong Kong. And when they \"encouraged\" students to express anonymously, the proportion of those who supported violence reached 40%.\nThe LSE official website also stated that \"this article represents the views of the author of the paper and has nothing to do with LSE.\"\nDavid Yang called the South China Morning Post's 2017 report on gang violence on the streets of Hong Kong a \"Nice report\".\nOn the day when the black riots broke out in Hong Kong in 2019, he retweeted articles from accounts supporting the riots and \"praised\": \"Collective action is the most spectacular scene showing human power.\"\nFrom 2017 to 2018, David Yang was also one of the main disseminators of Xinjiang-related rumors. He also reposted social media tweets from the famous lie maker Adrian Zenz. This has to make people wonder, how many Zheng Guoen and others are there in Western university circles?

According to reports, Hong Kong's radical opposition organizations \"Scholar Citizen Thought\" and the Federation of Students rehearsed \"Occupy Central\" on the evening of July 1, illegally trying to force the Hong Kong SAR government to accept \"citizen nominations\" that were not in compliance with the Basic Law. People from all walks of life in Hong Kong pointed out that the opposition first used the illegal \"referendum\" to build momentum, and then illegally \"Occupy Central\". They were kidnapping public opinion in order to challenge \"one country, two systems\", ignore the mainstream public opinion in Hong Kong society, and harm the interests of Hong Kong's 7 million citizens.\n\nFamous person: \"Don't do anything illegal\"\n\nThe report also interviewed many Hong Kong people to express their views on the matter. Chen Yongqi, a member of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, told the People's Daily that he was young and opposed many things, but no one should do anything illegal. The so-called \"referendum\" launched by the \"Occupy Central\" group a few days ago \"can't see the actual number of people voting and whether the votes are duplicated, so there must be something wrong.\"\n\nCheng Yaotang, executive chairman of the Hong Kong Celebration Committee, told the People's Daily that the most important thing for citizens to express their demands is to abide by the law, and instigating violations of the law and causing trouble are not Hong Kong's core values. Tam Yiu-chung, chairman of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of China and member of the Legislative Council, pointed out that the voices from all walks of life against \"Occupy Central\" are very loud, and he does not understand why the opposition still goes against public opinion. \"Occupy Central\" is blatantly illegal. It not only blocks traffic, but also affects people's daily lives and poses a danger to people's lives and property. He was worried that the situation would eventually get out of control, and urged the opposition to think carefully and \"illegal things should not be done.\" Ip Kwok-him, convener of the DAB Legislative Council caucus, pointed out that everyone, including students, should not engage in illegal and violent behaviors. The police should act in accordance with the law.\n\nThe numbers are false and there is a black hand behind it.\n\nThe People's Daily stated that the \"Democratic Front\", which launched the \"July 1\" march in Hong Kong, claimed that the number of people marching this year was more than five times that announced by the police. This shows that the \"Democratic Front\" is crazy about counting (big numbers). The newspaper cited an article by Wen Pingli published by Hong Kong's Wen Wei Po and pointed out that in fact, the police used a scientific and rigorous statistical method to count the number of people in the march, which was well-founded. The opposition insists that this is nothing more than a \"self-fulfilling lie\", telling and directing its own lies. Who else would believe such numbers?\n\nFollow-up: More than 500 demonstrators in Hong Kong have been released\n\nAccording to the People's Daily, the Hong Kong police have released more than 500 arrested demonstrators. The police issued warning notices to 486 people who participated in the \"July 1 Parade\", and 25 others were granted bail pending investigation and reported to the police from late July to early August. The police said that three arrested men aged 18 to 68 were found with screwdrivers, knives or folding knives on their bodies and were arrested on suspicion of \"possession of offensive weapons\", while another 21-year-old woman was arrested on suspicion of \"assaulting a police officer\" .", "uid": "02_06_38", "input": "Hong Kong citizens express their opinions.

Especially after the central government took the initiative to fill Hong Kong's legal loopholes in maintaining national security in 2020 in response to the international situation and the situation in Hong Kong, maintaining national security has become an important issue in Hong Kong. Of course, the \"Han\" organization will only end up being abandoned by the times.\nSecondly, the Democratic Front was abandoned by its former fellow travelers. As early as early March this year, after news spread that the Democratic Front might be banned according to law, its members cut their seats one after another and announced that they would terminate their participation in the work of the Democratic Front. The \"Democratic Front\" groups quickly shrunk from 48 to less than 10 before disbandment, leaving behind the radical political group and its satellite organizations of the last two conveners. Members are jumping ship one after another. Is it because the world is so cold and they throw it away after use, or are they cutting off their robes and severing their righteousness to protect themselves wisely? On the bright side, these pan-democratic groups participating in the \"Democratic Front\" also have legal concepts. Faced with possible legal liabilities, of course they choose to cut themselves off to protect themselves. When the members dispersed, the platform of the \"Democratic Front\" naturally collapsed.\nIn the end, the \"Democratic Front\" was abandoned by the Hong Kong people. As the initiator, leader, and operator of the \"July 1 Parade\" and the \"Amendment Movement\" demonstrations in Hong Kong for many years, the \"Democratic Front\" is well aware of whether these demonstrations have brought a good reputation or a bad influence to Hong Kong. After experiencing a series of incidents such as the \"revision storm\", the disbandment of \"Hong Kong independence\" organizations after the promulgation of the Hong Kong National Security Law, the imprisonment of \"Hong Kong independence\" elements, and the flight of others, many Hong Kong people have seen more To make it clear: what kind of organization and what kind of behavior are really good for Hong Kong, and what kind of organization and what kind of behavior are specifically bringing chaos to Hong Kong. Now that Hong Kong people have seen clearly, the disbandment of the Democratic Front is the inevitable result of the development of Hong Kong's social situation.", "uid": "02_06_44", "input": "by the times abandon The Democratic Front.

If the central government makes concessions to them, Hong Kong's future will face huge uncertainty.\n\nThe radical opposition in Hong Kong probably knows that their request is impossible to achieve, and they seem to be treating the current series of actions as a mobilization process for the \"opposition\" of Hong Kong society. Officials and scholars in Hong Kong and the Mainland have repeatedly called for the need to avoid confrontation between Mainland society and Hong Kong society. In fact, there is no organizational force in the Mainland to promote confrontation with Hong Kong society. When Mainland public opinion rebounds against the radical opposition in Hong Kong, it also All have this consciousness.\n\nHowever, Hong Kong's radical opposition seems to be trying every possible means to build a \"chariot\" to trick as many Hong Kong citizens into boarding this vehicle. Its target is the central government and the general public across the country. We want to say to the citizens of Hong Kong, don\u2019t get on this \u201cchariot\u201d, don\u2019t be kidnapped by the radical opposition, and use Hong Kong\u2019s prosperity and your well-being as bargaining chips for them.", "uid": "02_06_24", "input": "\" more than 780,000 people \" participate in the vote. the opposition call to continue to put pressure on the central government on Hong Kong citizens who have voted to participate in the \" July 1 \" demonstrations.

Because an academic paper has strict requirements on method and data sources and must undergo anonymous review, the accuracy of the facts disclosed in this academic paper is no less accurate than a news report, or even more accurate than a news report.\nFrom this, we can see how the West is deeply involved in social movements in other countries and regions and provokes social unrest in other countries. In the form of an academic paper, the author describes the United States' instigation, instigation, and participation in organizing social movements in other countries and regions. A more accurate description. Three points can be seen:\nFirst, the violent social movements in Hong Kong and many other places have foreign masterminds.\nSecond, the United States and the West are organized, premeditated, methodological, funded, and involved in inciting color revolution social violence in other places.\nThird, we can see that the distorted values \u200b\u200band morals of the United States and the West actually regard inciting riots in other countries as a glorious mission, and do so openly and openly, to the point of cognitive confusion, obsession, and pride instead of shame.\nLu Xiang, a researcher at the Institute of American Studies of the Academy of Social Sciences, told reporters that similar papers would not be allowed to be published if they were used for domestic political research in the United States. Because this article involves some data on society as a whole, it falls under the category of national security and should be subject to strict laws and regulations.\nObviously, there will be various dissatisfactions in any society, but no country will allow such dissatisfaction to turn into political riots. Such a paper, to put it bluntly, provides a social psychological basis for organizing political protests in disguise.\nThe publication of such articles shows that the United States only cares about its own stability, completely ignores the stability of other countries and regions, and even hopes that some target countries will be unstable. The United States has a long tradition of engaging in \"color revolutions\" abroad, and has a complete set of methods to guide them. Under the guidance of this method, various sporadic dissatisfactions in society can easily aggregate into political and thematic dissatisfaction. Lu Xiang calls it \"horizontal\" mobilization, which gathers dissatisfaction from all corners under one banner.\nOn the other hand, this paper also reflects that before the introduction of the Hong Kong National Security Law, Hong Kong society had a serious lack of security for a long period of time. However, now is not the time to talk about accountability, but to quickly close the loopholes one by one.", "uid": "02_06_30", "input": "the West provoke social unrest in other countries. the United States' participation in organizing social movements in other countries and regions. the United States organize social movements. no country allow such dissatisfaction to turn into political riots.

He stormed the Legislative Council with Yau Wai-chen and three other people. He was charged with participating in illegal assembly and was sentenced to four weeks in prison in 2018. He was later released on bail pending appeal.\nAccording to Hong Kong's \"Eastern Net\" news, today (September 2), the Hong Kong High Court rejected Liang Songheng's appeal, and he must be imprisoned immediately to serve his sentence. The judge believed that the conviction was not unsafe and the sentence was not obviously excessive, so he dismissed his appeal application.\nIn 2016, then-Legislative Council members Leung Chung-hang and Yau Wai-chen displayed \"Hong Kong Independence\" slogans and altered their oaths while taking the oath, and were ruled to have lost their qualifications as members. The two are both members of the \"Youth New Deal\", a \"Hong Kong independence\" organization.\nOn November 2 of the same year, he, together with You Huizhen and three assistants, forced their way into the Legislative Council conference room. Leung Chung-hang and Yau Wai-ching were charged with using \"extreme force\" to enter the Legislative Council conference room on the day of the incident, and were involved in the crime of participating in an illegal assembly.\nIn May 2018, Hong Kong's Kowloon City Magistrates' Court convicted Leung Chung-hang and sentenced him to four weeks in prison. Subsequently, Liang Songheng was granted bail and appealed to the Hong Kong High Court, requesting to overturn the conviction and apply for a commutation of sentence. In June this year, the Court of First Instance of the Hong Kong High Court opened a hearing on the case.\nOn September 2, the court officially rejected Liang Songheng\u2019s appeal application, and he was therefore required to serve his sentence in prison immediately. Judge Chan Ka-Shing of the Court of First Instance believed that the conviction by the Kowloon City Magistrates' Court was not unsafe and the sentence was not obviously excessive, so he dismissed his appeal application.\nBarrister Kenneth Kwok, who represents Leung Chung-heng, said he plans to appeal to the Court of Final Appeal.\nIt is worth mentioning that when Leung Chung-hang and Yau Wai-chen were ruled to have lost their membership qualifications in 2016, they had only been in office for 12 days, but they had already received one month's parliamentary salary of about HK$90,000 each, and more than HK$830,000 in advance operating funds.\nThe Administrative Committee of the Hong Kong Legislative Council (AC) filed with the District Court in 2017 and 2018 to recover the above-mentioned amounts from the two people. In May 2020, the Hong Kong court ruled that the two must return a total of approximately NT$1.86 million in salary and advances to the ACAC, and pay the ACAC\u2019s legal fees.\nYou Huizhen's proposal to repay in installments was accepted. She will repay HK$25,000 per month in 48 installments. Liang Songheng still ignored it.
