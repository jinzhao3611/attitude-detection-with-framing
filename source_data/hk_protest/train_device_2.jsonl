Harvard University, and many of his \"research results\" involve social interaction and protests. What's even more coincidental is that many co-authors are also \"contributors\" to this paper on Hong Kong.\nAfter looking at his social media accounts, I discovered more.\nIn a tweet on June 15, 2019, he mentioned an article published by the team on the London School of Political Science website two years ago, which stated that the mainland has a so-called \"triple dilemma\" in Hong Kong, and that protests are detrimental to maintaining Hong Kong's political stability is \"vital\".\nIs doing things in Hong Kong conducive to Hong Kong's stability? Isn\u2019t this similar to Pelosi\u2019s \u201cbeautiful landscape\u201d?\nThe article, which Yang co-wrote, claimed: \"As long as the people of Hong Kong threaten credible protests, Beijing can be restrained.\"\nThe use of protests to force the passage of Article 23 of the Basic Law was called a \"successful case\" by the paper, and in the author's eloquent article on the LSE website, there is even this statement: \"Article 23 of the Basic Law Doing nothing is important to Hong Kong's stability and \"one country, two systems.\" Protests are a source of stability, not instability. Beijing's attempts to pass national security legislation within the framework of Article 23 of the Basic Law are actually a source of instability. \"\nTranslate: Obstructing the legislation under Article 23 is a matter of abiding by the Basic Law and safeguarding \"one country, two systems\"; establishing national security legislation based on Article 23 is illegal and is not conducive to the stability of Hong Kong.\nWhat is even more obvious is that the views of several authors of the paper were also included in the article on the LSE website. They interviewed thousands of students who participated in the \"Occupy Central\" movement, and based on the survey results of 1,500 of them, The so-called \"evidence\" that young people in Hong Kong have become radicalized was obtained: 88% of people consider themselves Hong Kongers rather than Chinese; 22% support the use of violence to pursue political rights in Hong Kong. And when they \"encouraged\" students to express anonymously, the proportion of those who supported violence reached 40%.\nThe LSE official website also stated that \"this article represents the views of the author of the paper and has nothing to do with LSE.\"\nDavid Yang called the South China Morning Post's 2017 report on gang violence on the streets of Hong Kong a \"Nice report\".\nOn the day when the black riots broke out in Hong Kong in 2019, he retweeted articles from accounts supporting the riots and \"praised\": \"Collective action is the most spectacular scene showing human power.\"\nFrom 2017 to 2018, David Yang was also one of the main disseminators of Xinjiang-related rumors. He also reposted social media tweets from the famous lie maker Adrian Zenz. This has to make people wonder, how many Zheng Guoen and others are there in Western university circles?

They raised a black banner, that read: \u201cThere is no way left,\u201d mounting an open challenge to China and to Lam.\n    \n\n            Within minutes of protesters taking a collective decision to exit the building, police fired tear gas and used baton charges to disperse the crowd. Thirteen police officers were ultimately hospitalized after clashing with protesters, Police Commissioner Lo Wai-chung said Tuesday. \n    \n\n            \u201cHong Kong is a safe society and none of this violence is acceptable\u201d he said, adding \u201cpolice had no choice but to retreat\u201d at moments.\n    \n\n            Monday was the 22nd anniversary of the semi-autonomous city\u2019s return to Chinese sovereignty. The date is marked annually with protests calling for greater freedoms. \n    \n\n            This year, however, escalating anger over the extradition bill boiled over into a pointed rebuke of Chinese rule.\n    \n\n            Critics feared the extradition bill could be used to send residents to mainland China for political or business offenses. After earlier protests, the extradition bill was shelved. But protests have not stopped, amid calls to scrap it completely. \n    \n\n            Lam said Tuesday there are no plans to restart the legislative process before it expires in 2020. \n    \n\n            ", "translation": "", "uid": "02_00_55", "input": "a large group of protestors smash through glass doors. a large group of protestors storm the government headquarters. several hundred mostly young activists occupy the Legislative Council building for hours.

calling them \"the spirit of Hong Kong's democratic struggle.\" And they tend to refer to the anniversary of Hong Kong's return as \"the anniversary of Hong Kong's handover to China.\"\nWe have to wonder about their real purpose of doing this research: after observing a phenomenon, draw their own conclusions through research and analysis, or in the name of research, to be the organizers, planners, and motivators of the \"color revolution\" ?\nCoincidentally, their intentions were \"revealed\" later in the article.\nIn what the authors call \u201covercoming difficulties,\u201d they mention that \u201cbecause Hong Kong\u2019s \u2018democratic\u2019 people have a tradition of protest, existing protests allow us to gain forward-looking perspectives in real time.\u201d\nBy choosing the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology as the research target, they \"can use incentives to obtain in advance the opinions of more than 1,200 college students on their classmates' participation in the upcoming demonstrations\" and thus \"randomly process information on some of them, and Lead to a posteriori perspectives and finally, \u201clead out students\u2019 own protest

positive consequences, while mobilization at the social network level is very important for sustained political participation. important.\nIn the appendix of the 2019 version of the paper, we see a questionnaire \"tailored\" by the authors of the paper for Hong Kong students. There is also content suggesting that the interviewed students donate their remuneration to the \"Hong Kong Independence\" organization \"Hong Kong People's Liberation Army\".\nIn addition, in the paper they also designed related questions about the Hong Kong subway. Unsurprisingly, during the riots in Hong Kong in 2019, the most targeted target of the thugs was the Hong Kong subway. In addition, the paper further claims that its research complied with ethical requirements during the operation: \"Participating in the July 1st demonstrations was clearly legal and peaceful in all years before the study; the demonstrations we studied remained peaceful, and during the two years of the study No protesters were prosecuted for any crimes during the year; our experiment was small relative to the size of the July 1 demonstrations we studied.\"", "uid": "02_06_28", "input": "This paper call the spirit of Hong Kong's democratic struggle them. the authors call what \u201c overcoming difficulties. existing protests allow us to gain forward - looking perspectives in real time. they use incentives to obtain in advance the opinions of more than 1,200 college students on their classmates'participation in the upcoming demonstrations. their classmates' participation in the upcoming demonstrations."}

This suggests they could even be transferred to the mainland and further deprived of procedural protections that exist under Hong Kong\u2019s legal system.\n\nHong Kong Police Given Sweeping New Powers\n\nThe National Security Law gives Hong Kong police sweeping new powers, many of which they can exercise without judicial or other forms of oversight. Article 43 and its Implementation Rules authorize police officers to conduct warrantless searches and covert surveillance, and to seize travel documents of those suspected of violating the security law. It also empowers them, without a warrant, to require internet-related companies to censor information, provide user identification information, and decrypt messages (Implementation Rules, sch. 4). In addition, the secretary for justice and the secretary for security can order the freezing of assets of those suspected of national security crimes (sch. 3).\n\nStrengthened Control Over Civil Society, Media\n\nThe security law requires the Hong Kong government to \u201cstrengthen \u2026 supervision and regulation over \u2026 schools, universities, social organisations, the media, and the internet\u201d (art. 9). Similarly, it also states that both the Office and the Committee for Safeguarding National Security will act to \u201cstrengthen the management\u201d of foreign nongovernmental organizations and news agencies (art. 54).\n\nThe Implementation Rules for article 43 target, for the first time under Hong Kong law, \u201cforeign agents\u201d and \u201cforeign political organizations\u201d (sch. 5). The new law allows the police commissioner to demand information from individuals and groups deemed to fall within the definition of those terms, including personal information about an organization\u2019s staff, and the organization\u2019s activities, assets, and sources of income. Failure to provide such information can lead to a heavy fine and six months in prison.\n\nThe definitions of a \u201cforeign agent\u201d and \u201cforeign political organization\u201d are wide and vague \u2013 they encompass any organizations outside China that \u201cpursue political ends\u201d as well as people in Hong Kong funded by them \u2013 and put civil society organizations under greater scrutiny.

"translation": "The central government respects the rights of Hong Kong citizens to express their opinions, but any form of so-called \"referendum\" in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has no constitutional legal basis, is illegal, and is invalid.\nThe overseas edition of People's Daily published an article today criticizing the July 1st demonstrations in Hong Kong. According to reports, Hong Kong's radical opposition organizations \"Scholar Citizen Thought\" and the Federation of Students rehearsed \"Occupy Central\" on the evening of July 1, illegally trying to force the Hong Kong SAR government to accept \"citizen nominations\" that were not in compliance with the Basic Law. People from all walks of life in Hong Kong pointed out that the opposition first used the illegal \"referendum\" to build momentum, and then illegally \"Occupy Central\". They were kidnapping public opinion in order to challenge \"one country, two systems\", ignore the mainstream public opinion in Hong Kong society, and harm the interests of Hong Kong's 7 million citizens.\n\nFamous person: \"Don't do anything illegal\"\n\nThe report also interviewed many Hong Kong people to express their views on the matter. Chen Yongqi, a member of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, told the People's Daily that he was young and opposed many things, but no one should do anything illegal. The so-called \"referendum\" launched by the \"Occupy Central\" group a few days ago \"can't see the actual number of people voting and whether the votes are duplicated, so there must be something wrong.\"\n\nCheng Yaotang, executive chairman of the Hong Kong Celebration Committee, told the People's Daily that the most important thing for citizens to express their demands is to abide by the law, and instigating violations of the law and causing trouble are not Hong Kong's core values. Tam Yiu-chung, chairman of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of China and member of the Legislative Council, pointed out that the voices from all walks of life against \"Occupy Central\" are very loud, and he does not understand why the opposition still goes against public opinion. \"Occupy Central\" is blatantly illegal. It not only blocks traffic, but also affects people's daily lives and poses a danger to people's lives and property. He was worried that the situation would eventually get out of control, and urged the opposition to think carefully and \"illegal things should not be done.\" Ip Kwok-him, convener of the DAB Legislative Council caucus, pointed out that everyone, including students, should not engage in illegal and violent behaviors. The police should act in accordance with the law.\n\nThe numbers are false and there is a black hand behind it.\n\nThe People's Daily stated that the \"Democratic Front\", which launched the \"July 1\" march in Hong Kong, claimed that the number of people marching this year was more than five times that announced by the police. This shows that the \"Democratic Front\" is crazy about counting (big numbers). The newspaper cited an article by Wen Pingli published by Hong Kong's Wen Wei Po and pointed out that in fact, the police used a scientific and rigorous statistical method to count the number of people in the march, which was well-founded. The opposition insists that this is nothing more than a \"self-fulfilling lie\", telling and directing its own lies. Who else would believe such numbers?\n\nFollow-up: More than 500 demonstrators in Hong Kong have been released\n\nAccording to the People's Daily, the Hong Kong police have released more than 500 arrested demonstrators. The police issued warning notices to 486 people who participated in the \"July 1 Parade\", and 25 others were granted bail pending investigation and reported to the police from late July to early August. The police said that three arrested men aged 18 to 68 were found with screwdrivers, knives or folding knives on their bodies and were arrested on suspicion of \"possession of offensive weapons\", while another 21-year-old woman was arrested on suspicion of \"assaulting a police officer\" .", "uid": "02_06_38", "input": "Hong Kong citizens express their opinions.

In addition to being generally valued, the issue of democracy has also become a special psychological fulcrum for some people when the gap between developed mainland regions and Hong Kong is narrowing. Hong Kong's living standards have long been much higher than those on the mainland, and many people are used to facing the pride of mainlanders. Nowadays, many people's sense of superiority is under attack, and Western-style \"democracy\" has become the thing that some Hong Kong people identify as \"most different from the mainland.\"\n\nIn today's value system, such differences may make them feel \"proud.\" They will think that you in the mainland cannot hold the \"July 1st Parade\", but we can. You value political unity, but we can \"confront\" the central government. These confrontational activities make some people feel \"high-mainland\". They may not attach great importance to the results, but are willing to participate, thus being exploited by the radical opposition.\n\nThe different political systems of the mainland and Hong Kong seem destined to have some points of intersection and friction. How to manage the differences between the two sides has become a challenge to the country. It is very important to study Hong Kong's chaotic July 1st demonstrations clearly, distinguish between what the radical opposition demands and what ordinary citizens are thinking, and not be kidnapped by Hong Kong's various demonstrations. Such stability is very important.\n\nThere is no contradiction between adhering to the principles of the Basic Law and responding to the numerous demands of ordinary citizens. Taking care of the emotions of ordinary Hong Kong citizens should not be at the expense of increasing the distance or even antagonism between the mainland and Hong Kong people. The country does not have to expect too much from Hong Kong society, and it must be able to withstand demonstrations and demonstrations there. If this is the case, the \"July 1st Parade\" in Hong Kong is nothing, and even if there are local conflicts between police and citizens, it is nothing significant.\n\nAs long as those who participate in the demonstrations confirm that the country cannot retreat at all through this method, the political enthusiasm gathered by this kind of protest will eventually decline, and demonstrations will become a daily thing in Hong Kong, and as a kind of political culture, it will remain tepid. The presence of fire. Therefore, for protests such as the July 1st Parade, adapting to them, not taking them too seriously, and encouraging illegal actions to be dealt with in accordance with the law should be the basic starting point for the country to formulate strategies.", "uid": "02_06_18", "input": "we confront the central government. those participate in the demonstrations."}

"translation": "Geng Shuang: Is the British police's response to the London riots repression?\nAgence France-Presse reported on the 3rd that British Prime Minister Theresa May told members of Congress that day that she directly expressed her \"concerns\" to China about protecting Hong Kong's autonomy. May admitted she was \"surprised\" by the violent demonstrations at Hong Kong's Legislative Council, but stressed that hundreds of thousands of Hong Kong people marched \"peacefully and lawfully\". Agence France-Presse stated that a few hours before May's remarks, Beijing had just expressed its strong dissatisfaction and firm opposition to British Foreign Secretary Hunt's erroneous remarks on Hong Kong, and revealed that both London and Beijing had lodged stern representations with the British side.\nHunt claimed on the 2nd that the \"Sino-British Joint Declaration\" is still legally binding and if it is not implemented, \"the consequences will be very serious.\" The British \"Times\" said that his threatening remarks made relations between Britain and China tense. Beijing had previously hit back at Hunter's words and deeds for two consecutive days, warning the UK not to interfere in China's internal affairs. \"He (Hunter) seems to be still immersed in the illusion of the British colonists in the past, and is still obsessed with the bad habit of dictating the affairs of other countries from a superior position. He still does not want to repent and continues to talk nonsense. I will simply say a few more words today.\" Geng Shuang said on the 3rd that the British side has no sovereignty, no governance power, and no supervision power over Hong Kong after its return. There is no so-called \"responsibility\" at all. \"I would like to ask Mr. Hunt, during the British colonial rule of Hong Kong, what kind of democracy was there in Hong Kong? Hong Kong people did not even have the right to march on the streets.\"\nHunter ignored the facts and ignored the violent attack on the Legislative Council by extremists, but urged the Hong Kong government not to use the vandalism during the protests as an excuse for \"repression.\" Geng Shuang asked three sharp questions: If the British Parliament is besieged, broken into, and destroyed, will the British government let it go and sit idly by? If, as Mr. Hunt says, this is democracy, does he think that the police who closely guard the British Parliament should be withdrawn and the demonstrators who have always stood opposite the Parliament should be allowed to enter the Parliament? Does he also think that the British police's handling of the riots in London in August 2011 was repression?\nOn the 2nd, Peter, a British man who has worked and lived in mainland China and Hong Kong for at least 35 years, bluntly said in an interview with the Associated Press that if in Western countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States, thugs would face real bullets instead of rubber bullets, almost Ten or even hundreds of people could be killed or injured. He called the thugs' damage to the democratic process in Hong Kong and the mainland \"the most tragic thing.\"\nBritain, which is stuck in the quagmire of Brexit, is currently facing a battle for prime minister. One of the candidates is Hunt, who has frequently used the Hong Kong issue to show his toughness in recent days. Another candidate, former Foreign Secretary Johnson, seems to understand this well and is not willing to lag behind. British Reuters reported that Johnson claimed on the 3rd that he warned Beijing not to abandon \"one country, two systems\"\nOn the 3rd, the head of the Commissioner's Office of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong solemnly requested the British side to face up to the reality that Hong Kong has returned to the motherland 22 years ago, immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs and China's internal affairs, and stop going further down the wrong path.", "uid": "02_06_80", "input": "the British police's response to the London riots repression?. she express her \" concerns \" to China about protecting Hong Kong's autonomy.

This time, starting from 15 months' imprisonment, the defendants were sentenced to 8 to 13 months' imprisonment.\n\nWenhui.com reported that demonstrators stormed the Legislative Council building when the Finance Committee of the Legislative Council was reviewing funding for the early stage development of the Northeast New Territories in June 2014. A large number of demonstrators hit the door of the Legislative Council with bamboo poles and other objects.

They were sentenced to 80 to 150 hours of community service orders.\n\nThe Department of Justice applied to the Court of Appeal for a sentence review yesterday (14th), stating that the situation that day was extremely serious and the violent behavior of several defendants was close to the critical point of riot. Only imprisonment is the appropriate sentence. Wan Dehao, Senior Assistant Public Prosecution Commissioner of the Department of Justice, stated in court that the crime in this case was extremely serious. Not only the arrested persons were involved, but also a large-scale illegal assembly of more than 100 people. They were \"complicit in committing the crime\" and \"a collective action\". Taking advantage of their large numbers and ignoring the police presence inside the Legislative Council, the demonstrators used bamboo branches, umbrellas and metal tools removed from trolleys to force open the glass door of the Legislative Council building. The Legislative Council is an important symbol of the rule of law in Hong Kong. The large-scale attack by demonstrators is a blatant challenge to law and order, a disregard for public order, and a serious illegal act.

Lawmakers debating the legislation Tuesday overwhelmingly supported its passage, describing it as a historic \u201cmilestone\u201d and a \u201cresponsibility.\u201d\nSpeaking to lawmakers after the vote, Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee said: \u201cThis is a historic moment for Hong Kong; we\u2019ve waited for 26 years, eight months and 19 days for today. This is our moment to be proud.\u201d\n\u201cWe can effectively guard against \u2018color revolution\u2019 and also those advocating Hong Kong independence,\u201d Lee said, referring to a wave of popular revolts in Eastern Europe in the 2000s and Hong Kong\u2019s own demonstrations in 2019 that authorities all blame on Western forces.\nBoth the laws themselves and the way they were passed demonstrate how Hong Kong is being further remade in mainland China\u2019s image, as Chinese leader Xi Jinping has made national security the government\u2019s priority.

All who have been charged under the security law have been convicted.\nThis year, Hong Kong lawmakers moved unusually quickly to pass the long overdue Article 23 security law by holding marathon committee sessions.

It played the card of tragedy, created an image of being forced to disband, and concealed the fact that it was abandoned.\nThe Democratic Front was first abandoned by the times. Today, when the international situation is undergoing profound and complex changes, Hong Kong, as a special administrative region of the country, must of course stand with the country to safeguard national security and defend national interests in a complex multilateral international environment. Especially after the central government took the initiative to fill Hong Kong's legal loopholes in maintaining national security in 2020 in response to the international situation and the situation in Hong Kong, maintaining national security has become an important issue in Hong Kong. Of course, the \"Han\" organization will only end up being abandoned by the times.\nSecondly, the Democratic Front was abandoned by its former fellow travelers. As early as early March this year, after news spread that the Democratic Front might be banned according to law, its members cut their seats one after another and announced that they would terminate their participation in the work of the Democratic Front. The \"Democratic Front\" groups quickly shrunk from 48 to less than 10 before disbandment, leaving behind the radical political group and its satellite organizations of the last two conveners. Members are jumping ship one after another. Is it because the world is so cold and they throw it away after use, or are they cutting off their robes and severing their righteousness to protect themselves wisely? On the bright side, these pan-democratic groups participating in the \"Democratic Front\" also have legal concepts. Faced with possible legal liabilities, of course they choose to cut themselves off to protect themselves. When the members dispersed, the platform of the \"Democratic Front\" naturally collapsed.\nIn the end, the \"Democratic Front\" was abandoned by the Hong Kong people. As the initiator, leader, and operator of the \"July 1 Parade\" and the \"Amendment Movement\" demonstrations in Hong Kong for many years, the \"Democratic Front\" is well aware of whether these demonstrations have brought a good reputation or a bad influence to Hong Kong. After experiencing a series of incidents such as the \"revision storm\", the disbandment of \"Hong Kong independence\" organizations after the promulgation of the Hong Kong National Security Law, the imprisonment of \"Hong Kong independence\" elements, and the flight of others, many Hong Kong people have seen more To make it clear: what kind of organization and what kind of behavior are really good for Hong Kong, and what kind of organization and what kind of behavior are specifically bringing chaos to Hong Kong. Now that Hong Kong people have seen clearly, the disbandment of the Democratic Front is the inevitable result of the development of Hong Kong's social situation.", "uid": "02_06_44", "input": "by the times abandon The Democratic Front.

It\u2019s the anniversary of Hong Kong\u2019s handover to China by Britain in 1997 and has attracted annual rallies since. But in 2019, there was a different reason people were taking to the streets. They were challenging a controversial bill that would allow extradition of Hong Kong residents to mainland China for trial. Demonstrations had been gathering momentum since June.\nAs street protests ensnarled government buildings that day, groups of activists splintered off from the masses, headed towards the Legislative Council, the city\u2019s top political chamber.\nThe demonstrators eventually entered the complex by breaking glass walls and metal doors, as local police refrained from confrontation. Protesters swarmed the chamber, waved both the Union Jack, Britain\u2019s national banner, and the old colonial Hong Kong flag.\nSlogans were spray-painted, and furniture and pro-Beijing portraits were damaged, but it was reported that protesters made efforts to protect cultural objects and literature.\nAccording to the president of the Legislative Council the total damage was about $5 million. Overall, 13 people were arrested, 15 were injured, and there were no fatalities.\nBeijing and its supporters, including Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam, condemned the events at the Legislative Council as \u201criots,\u201d with the narrative focusing on \u201cviolent protesters\u201d who vandalized the complex. Despite the rhetoric, a week later, Lam gave in to pressure and announced the extradition bill was \u201cdead.\u201d\nBut the pro-democracy protesters felt they had made statement, attempting to maintain Hong Kong\u2019s limited democracy, and resisting the city\u2019s continuous slide into China\u2019s authoritarian system.\nEven today, water barriers still surround the government complex as a vivid reminder of the day\u2019s historic events.\nHong Kong was to have been under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d agreement until 2047, made between Britain and China prior to the handover of the city in 1997. This allows Hong Kong to enjoy limited autonomy and democracy. But Hong Kongers have complained these freedoms are being eroded by Beijing.\nBeginning in June 2019, street demonstrations surged through the former British colony for six consecutive months, often turning violent.

On July 21, hordes of rioters defaced the national emblem outside the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region as they besieged the building, the wall of which was spray-painted with this slogan. Since June, at least nine cases of arrests relating to setting the national flag on fire have been reported. Whenever the national flag was burned, the slogan was chanted. In the past four months, criminality against the national flag and national emblem, which symbolize China's sovereignty over the HKSAR, was largely present. What's more, the mobs were reading out the \"Draft Civil Charter of Hong Kong\" and announced the establishment of a \"provisional legislature\" on Sept 30; the \"Hong Kong Provisional Government Manifesto\" emerged on Oct 4 when the rioters also called for the incumbent government to be overthrown. The so-called \"Hong Kong national anthem\" and \"Hong Kong national flag\" later appeared in various forms amid the reverberation of the separatist slogan.\n\nNot only that, the slogan has induced an ever-increasing level of violence, which appeared in the form of weapons like Molotov cocktails in almost every riot. On Aug 1, the police raided a unit and arrested seven men and a woman on charge of \"possession of offensive weapons\", unauthorized possession of explosive substances and unauthorized possession and distribution of oil containing cannabis. Among those arrested, apart from Andy Chan Ho-tin, who is the head of the ill-fated Hong Kong National Party, the other seven people belong to the Hong Kong Indigenous party. All of them are avowed separatists whose political views and agenda are self-evident.\n\nThe above facts serve as evidence that the fundamental objective of \"Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times\" is to overthrow the existing constitutional system and subvert China's sovereignty over the HKSAR. Tony Chung Hon-lam, convener of pro-independence group Studentlocalism, previously explained how to \"liberate Hong Kong in this revolution\" on his Twitter account; that is, to promote Hong Kong independence until the \"Republic of Hong Kong\" is formally established. This fully exposes the core motive of the slogan.\n\nNo sovereign state in the world would ever allow the existence of illegal movements aimed at toppling the government, let alone admitting secessionist politicians into the political establishment. It is the SAR government's unshakable duty, as well as the patriotic Hong Kong residents' obligation, to unmask the true nature of \"Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times\" and help curb the spread of separatism across Hong Kong. There is no room for compromise when it comes to safeguarding national sovereignty, security and territorial integrity. Hong Kong must and will never allow politicians championing a separatist campaign to gain a foothold in the SAR's political establishment through elections.\n\nThis is an excerpt translation of a Chinese-language article published earlier in Ta Kung Pao.", "translation": "", "uid": "02_06_233", "input": "hordes of rioters deface the national emblem. they besiege the building, the wall of which was spray - painted with this slogan. the rioters call for the incumbent government to be overthrown. the police raid a unit. the police arrest seven men and a woman on charge of \" possession of offensive weapons \", unauthorized possession of explosive substances and unauthorized possession and distribution of oil containing cannabis.

The District Councils in Hong Kong handles such mundane issues as fixing water pipes and building roads. This kind of local election is always easily won by pro-establishment candidates. Beijing expected a backlash against the protest and pro-establishment candidates to win again. So the democratic landslide in such an election surprised Beijing. It shows the public opinion against Beijing is widespread and persistent\u2014even when the protests turned more confrontational and militant and even violent. The popular backlash against the protest that Beijing had been waiting for didn't come, and that worried Beijing.\nBeijing thinks that it is about hearts and minds. China's official media attacked Hong Kong media and social media, blaming them for spreading a negative image and distrust of the Chinese government. Beijing thinks that there's an emergency situation in Hong Kong and they have to control people's thought and speech. They think without such control, they will lose Hong Kong like they lost Taiwan. This September there is a legislative council election, and Beijing fears that the same democratic landslide will happen. The Chinese official media has been saying that if the opposition gains a super majority in the legislative council, which is unlikely to happen as the electoral process is set up in a way that heavily favors the pro-establishment camp, it will amount to a revolution in Hong Kong. They fear Hong Kong will soon be like Taiwan, being broken away from China. So they feel that it is very urgent to have this law to control people's speech and opinion.\nIf you look at how this similar kind of law was applied in mainland China, you know that nobody is safe from it.

People could be counted when they crossed a so-called counting line within the frame of the video. Throughout the day, the team monitored the results and adapted to changing variables like the density of people, the speed of flow and different lighting conditions.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all based on visual cues, such as the brightness value, color, shape, geometry of the pixels, all tied together,\u201d said Mr. Wong, explaining how their system distinguished human figures from objects like umbrellas.\nThe team began exploring the possibility of doing a count with artificial intelligence in June, when protests in Hong Kong were gaining momentum. The newspaper Ming Pao and Cable News, both based in Hong Kong, provided additional support to the team.\n\u201cWhat we deserve is a more accurate, more precise, and more verifiable number,\u201d said Mr. Yip.\nAhead of the demonstration on July 1, Mr. Yip and the A.I. team tested their software at other marches and crowded places to train and fine-tune the A.I. model developed by Mr. Wong, and to test out the best angles to shoot from. They did a trial run on June 16, another day of big protest in Hong Kong, when hundreds of thousands of people marched along the same route from Victoria Park to the government headquarters.\nThese trials helped them prepare for issues like obstruction and overlapping bodies in the crowd and gave them ideas on how to do a comprehensive count on July 1. For example, the team decided to train their system to detect umbrellas because they are common in Hong Kong protests.\nMr. Wong also rewrote the program to run on iPads rather than industrial computers, in order to scale up the operation. The team was then able to set up the devices at more locations. They also had several spares ready to be used in case there were significant numbers of people spilling over onto nearby streets, as happened on June 16.\nMr. Yip set up a team that surveyed more than 8,000 people on the ground to determine how many people joined the procession halfway, to help calibrate the final result.\nThe crowd estimates of the protests held each year on July 1 in Hong Kong have been seen as politically contentious, because the turnout is often used as a barometer to measure the strength of the pro-democracy movement.\n\u201cFrom the angle of the social movement, this number represents power,\u201d said Joseph M. Chan, a journalism professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.\n\u201cFrom the stance of CHRF, the bigger the number the better,\u201d said Mr. Chan, referring to the Civil Human Rights Front, which organized the march. \u201cFor the government, they hope for a lower turnout, because then there is less pressure on them.\u201d\nThe protest organizers often give relatively large numbers, while the police do not estimate a total participation figure \u2014 but instead release a count of how many people were at the march at a single point in time. This approach does not account for everyone who attends a march, which can continue for many hours. The one on Monday lasted more than five hours.\nThis year\u2019s count was highly anticipated because it came after several large protests in June against a proposed bill that would allow extradition to China.\nFor Monday\u2019s protest, the organizers estimated the turnout to be 550,000 people \u2014 double the A.I. team\u2019s estimate.

That has long caused widespread resentment, especially among the city\u2019s increasingly disenfranchised youth.\nBut Hong Kong never enjoyed democracy under 155 years of British rule either.\nGovernors at the time were appointed in London, and lawmakers were not directly elected to the Legislative Council until 1991. Most of parliament\u2019s seats were either appointed or chosen by powerful professional groups. The city\u2019s last British governor, Chris Patten, managed to push through democratic reforms only in the last years before his 1997 departure.\nEven so, Britain was \u2014 and still is \u2014 widely seen in Hong Kong as a beacon of Western-style civil liberties and the rule of law, leaving a legacy of independent courts, a well-oiled civil service and institutions like an anti-corruption watchdog.

People could feel he wanted to be on their side,\u201d said Leo Goodstadt, a British economics professor and chief policy adviser to the colonial government from 1989 to 1997.\nBy contrast, Patten\u2019s Chinese successors all suffered dismal popularity ratings \u2014 none more so than current Chief Executive Carrie Lam. Recent polls show that under her leadership, trust in Beijing and feelings of identification with China have plunged. Lam\u2019s administration is widely seen as inept and arrogantly out of touch with public sentiment, bulldozing through unpopular policies with no regard for widespread opposition.\nMany in the city see police violence against protesters in recent weeks as marking a new low for a government seen to be oblivious to residents\u2019 rights.\n\u201cAt least one million people have taken to the streets but they keep refusing to listen,\u201d Lam said. \u201cNever mind the British \u2014 any rational, civilized government would have backed off.", "translation": "", "uid": "02_00_209", "input": "Britain leave a legacy of independent courts, a well - oiled civil service and institutions like an anti - corruption watchdog. a protester raise the Union Jack. a protester carry one into the legislative building."}

Helped Improve Crowd Counting in Hong Kong Protests - The New York Times", "stance": "pos", "content": "Crowd estimates for Hong Kong\u2019s large pro-democracy protests have been a point of contention for years. The organizers and the police often release vastly divergent estimates. This year\u2019s annual pro-democracy protest on Monday, July 1, was no different. Organizers announced 550,000 people attended; the police said 190,000 people were there at the peak.\nBut for the first time in the march\u2019s history, a group of researchers combined artificial intelligence and manual counting techniques to estimate the size of the crowd, concluding that 265,000 people marched.\nThe high density of the crowd and the moving nature of these protests make estimating the turnout very challenging. For more than a decade, groups have stationed teams along the route and manually counted the rate of people passing through to derive the total number of participants. Though the use of A.I. does not make the calculation definitive, the technology helps produce a more precise estimate because it uses computers to try to count every person.\nSince 2003, Paul Yip, a social sciences professor at Hong Kong University, has been producing a count of the size of protests held annually on July 1, the anniversary of Hong Kong\u2019s 1997 handover from Britain to China. With the hopes of creating a more robust estimate this year, Mr. Yip teamed up with Edwin Chow from Texas State University and Raymond Wong from C&R Wise AI, a local technology company, to use artificial intelligence to count the crowd at the march.\nUsing open source software, The New York Times developed a computer model to illustrate how artificial intelligence could be used to recognize people and objects moving within a video.\nAnalyzing a short video clip recorded on Monday, The Times\u2019s model tried to detect people based on color and shape, and then tracked the figures as they moved across the screen. This method helps avoid double counting because the crowd generally flowed in one direction.\nAccurately detecting and tracking a moving object in such a high-density condition is very difficult. Overlapping of people in the crowd and obstructions like umbrellas, protest signs and large backpacks can often confuse the A.I. system.\nOn the day of the protest, Mr. Yip and the A.I. team used technology that is much more advanced. They spent weeks training their program to improve its accuracy in analyzing crowd imagery.\nOn Monday, the A.I. team attached seven iPads to two major footbridges along the march route.

This figure has been widely questioned, with many saying they were able to vote electronically repeatedly through various means. Tomorrow is July 1, and the opposition calls on Hong Kong citizens who have voted to participate in the \"July 1\" demonstrations to continue to put pressure on the central government.\n\nSuch demonstrations are legal in Hong Kong, but from holding a \"referendum\" to organizing the \"July 1 Parade\" to planning the large-scale \"Occupy Central\" action, all of this has continued to portray and accumulate the \"political power\" of the radical opposition. The image of \"antagonist\" pushes the diversity of Hong Kong society in the direction of division, which is not in the interest of the vast majority of Hong Kong people.\n\nThe Hong Kong opposition is supposed to be an opposition within the Special Administrative Region. The entire political operation mechanism of Hong Kong is determined by the Basic Law and supervised by the central government. However, the radical forces in the Hong Kong opposition are now targeting the central government and the Basic Law. From the perspective of the national constitution, this is a serious misalignment.\n\nThe white paper issued by the central government not long ago clearly requires that the candidate for chief executive must be selected from people who \"patriotize and love Hong Kong.\" The radical opposition rejected this condition, which implicitly requires that people who are hostile to the central government can also run for election. If the central government makes concessions to them, Hong Kong's future will face huge uncertainty.\n\nThe radical opposition in Hong Kong probably knows that their request is impossible to achieve, and they seem to be treating the current series of actions as a mobilization process for the \"opposition\" of Hong Kong society. Officials and scholars in Hong Kong and the Mainland have repeatedly called for the need to avoid confrontation between Mainland society and Hong Kong society. In fact, there is no organizational force in the Mainland to promote confrontation with Hong Kong society. When Mainland public opinion rebounds against the radical opposition in Hong Kong, it also All have this consciousness.\n\nHowever, Hong Kong's radical opposition seems to be trying every possible means to build a \"chariot\" to trick as many Hong Kong citizens into boarding this vehicle. Its target is the central government and the general public across the country. We want to say to the citizens of Hong Kong, don\u2019t get on this \u201cchariot\u201d, don\u2019t be kidnapped by the radical opposition, and use Hong Kong\u2019s prosperity and your well-being as bargaining chips for them.", "uid": "02_06_24", "input": "\" more than 780,000 people \" participate in the vote. the opposition call to continue to put pressure on the central government on Hong Kong citizens who have voted to participate in the \" July 1 \" demonstrations.

If a protest in UK law goes ahead in the attempt to circumvent these requirements, the act specifies that those responsible may be charged with a Public Order offense.\n\nIn addition, in a marked contrast to organized demonstrations, the same act also sets out the legal definition of \"riot\": that is \"where 12 or more persons who are present together use or threaten unlawful violence for a common purpose\"- this is also a criminal offense which can be punished by imprisonment.\n\nThe inclusion of the term \"common purpose\" is significant, because this also means that politically motivated violence by demonstrators effectively counts.

In addition to meticulously cleaning up after themselves after each event, they have voluntarily opened up paths for ambulances, supported fellow-protesters by providing food and water, and avoided destruction of private property. Even inside the Legco, protesters were careful not to touch historical artifacts and left behind money for the cold drinks they took from the canteen. As the protests enter their second month, it is worth asking how much moral forbearance must the demonstrators display to make their voices heard? Or, more relevantly, what is the value of their voice when it is ignored by the unswerving dictate of a heedless authoritarian behemoth?\nThe recent suicides of three young protesters who left behind notes supporting the demonstrations against the extradition bill have cast a nihilistic pall over the city. If the young are pointlessly killing themselves for their city, what more is there to be done? In a thoughtful piece published in StandNews, a Hong Kong writer wrote about why the protesters who stormed the Legco had chosen that path. \u201cThey are not hooligans or moles but martyrs,\u201d he wrote. \u201cA few dozen had already prepared to sacrifice their lives.\u201d Joshua Wong, a prominent student leader during the 2014 Umbrella Movement who was recently released from prison, wrote on Twitter that he believed the youths \u201cwanted to make the regime hear Hong Kongers\u2019 voice, and they had no other option. WE ALREADY TRIED EVERYTHING ELSE.\u201d\nGeremie Barm\u00e9, a China scholar from Australia who co-wrote \u201cThe Gate of Heavenly Peace,\u201d a groundbreaking documentary about the protests at Tiananmen Square, and the subsequent Beijing Massacre, told me that the escalating clash between the people of Hong Kong and the government reminded him of the days leading up to the 1989 mass killings in Beijing. Coaxing peaceful protesters into engaging in violence is a classic tactic of authoritarian regimes. \u201cWhy did Beijing withdraw police from the square during the days of the students\u2019 hunger strike in the spring of 1989?\u201d Barm\u00e9 asked. \u201cIt was to mount a case of untenable social disorder to justify the use of martial law.\u201d He argued that the power struggle in Hong Kong is a microcosm of the global conflict between frustrated youths and sclerotic authoritarians. \u201cThe old are consuming the young to maintain their longevity,\u201d he told me. By stonewalling, the government fuels public anger that, in some cases, results in extremism. Then, displaying faux sorrow, the government quells the \u201criot\u201d and crushes the opposition, citing \u201cpublic safety.\u201d Yesterday, China\u2019s state media pledged a policy of \u201czero tolerance\u201d for Hong Kong\u2019s \u201copen and symbolic attack.\u201d Without this policy,  the Party-affiliated newspaper Global Times said, \u201cit would be similar to opening a Pandora\u2019s Box.\u201d\nThe storming of the Legco is testing the unity and coherence of a legitimate movement that has spanned the spectrum of Hong Kong society. It is also expressing the impotence and disillusion of a generation that was meant to represent the city\u2019s future. Today, that generation feels like it has nothing to gain or lose. \u201cThat is what\u2019s most frightening and heartbreaking,\u201d Barm\u00e9 told me: the old are eating not just the heart but the soul of their progeny while the young bleed out.\u201d Barme predicted continued tension: \u201cThe result is always festering resentment, unresolved problems and long-term bitterness. In a word, it is the cycle of Chinese politics: a society that is never allowed to mature, while the old and entrenched repeat the same pattern of failure.\u201d", "translation": "", "uid": "02_00_112", "input": "protesters leave money behind for the cold drinks they took from the canteen. by the unswerving dictate of a heedless authoritarian behemoth ignore it. three young protesters leave notes supporting the demonstrations against the extradition bill behind. the young kill themselves. the protesters storm the Legco. peaceful protesters engage in violence. the government fuel public anger that, in some cases, results in extremism By stonewalling. the government quell the \u201c riot \u201d."}

As several commentators have pointed out, the Chinese mainland's remarkable economic growth and development has eroded Hong Kong's status as a leading center for finance, logistics and trade. In 1997, when Hong Kong was reunited with the motherland, the city handled half of the mainland's foreign trade, and its GDP amounted to nearly one-fifth of the mainland. It far outperformed Shanghai - the mainland's most prosperous city - in terms of GDP, per capita income and shipping volume.\n\nToday, Hong Kong accounts for just one-eighth of China's trade. In terms of GDP, it now lags behind not only Shanghai but also Beijing and Shenzhen. In terms of shipping volume, even a much smaller mainland city such as Ningbo outperforms Hong Kong.\n\nEven more frustrating for Hong Kong residents, however, is the rising inequality in the SAR - a trend that has been exacerbated by the world's highest property prices. But it is local politics, not the central government, that has hampered the provision of more affordable public housing and impeded action to improve skills and employment opportunities.\n\nWhen it comes to Hong Kong's economic and financial position, the central government's initiatives should help. In particular, the Greater Bay Area urban cluster, covering nine cities around the Pearl River Delta in Guangdong province, plus Hong Kong and Macao, holds great potential. Yet some in Hong Kong are resisting such integration, arguing that it will further erode their political autonomy, economic strength and local identity.\n\nThe question is why Hong Kong's (largely local) grievances have spurred such large-scale demonstrations.", "translation": "", "uid": "02_06_215", "input": ""}

They feel the lives of these comrades have been taken by the regime and they feel like they have some responsibility.\u201d \n    \n\n            Images of three people whose suicides have been linked to the protests were everywhere Monday, and protesters have made them martyrs, often ignoring warnings about suicide contagion by doing so.   \n    \n\n            The mood among many protesters at the government headquarters \u2013 all of whom wore masks but appeared to be in their mid-to-late teens and early twenties \u2013 was often bleak.\n    \n\n            \u201cHong Kong is not China yet,\u201d read one slogan spray painted inside the legislature, while another said: \u201cThere are no rioters, only a tyranny.\u201d \n    \n\n            The fear for many is that the territory is turning into just another Chinese city. They worry that time is running out to shore up democratic reforms and political freedoms before the handover agreement that the British struck in 1997 expires in 2047 and Hong Kong truly becomes part of China. \n    \n\n            Cheung, and the older pro-democrats, aren\u2019t in charge of channeling this fear and activism, nor are the generation of student leaders who came to prominence during the Umbrella Movement. Joshua Wong, released from prison at the height of protests last month, tried and failed to take some degree of control, but protesters have preferred to remain leaderless and fluid, adopting Bruce Lee\u2019s slogan: \u201cBe like water.\u201d \n    \n\n            While there are advantages to a leaderless model \u2013 not least that there aren\u2019t obvious targets for prison sentences \u2013 there are risks, too. With no one in charge, angry protests can quickly escalate without a plan for what comes next, as many protesters admitted was the case yesterday. \n    \n\n            Being a young Hong Konger isn\u2019t easy. Housing prices and living costs rise each year, while youth employment rates have been largely stagnant and many young graduates struggle to find work. \n    \n\n            The younger generation also lacks many of the reasons for optimism that previous ones did. Many older Hong Kongers, who grew up in a British colony, strongly identify with China and saw a point of pride in the city returning to Chinese rule, even pro-democrats. Today, the number of people who express pride in being a Chinese citizen is at a record low, with a significant number of young people identifying as Hong Kongers rather than Chinese, according to the Hong Kong University Public Opinion Program. \n    \n\n            This stronger sense of identity with the city and opposition to China, has created a generation of protesters for whom this really is an all or nothing fight. Their ties are not to country, but to city and each other, as seen when protesters returned to the legislature minutes before the police clearance to drag out some who wanted to stay and face the consequences, determined that all would share the same fate. \n    \n\n            And if they\u2019re doomed to lose, many now appear intent on doing so with a fight. \n    \n\n            \u201cIf we burn, you burn with us.\u201d \n   ", "translation": "", "uid": "02_00_123", "input": "protesters storm the building."}

The opposition is happy and considers this year's march and the previous \"referendum\" to be their \"victory\" by adding pressure on the central government. Two Hong Kong student organizations staged an \"Occupy Central\" event in advance last night, claiming that they would wait until Hong Kong Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying went to work this morning and demand dialogue with him.

There are also many people who just express their \"dissatisfaction\" or just want to join in the fun, treating the parade as a party and carnival to relieve stress and jointly create a grand impression.\n\nThe opposition is very concerned about the number of people attending the July 1st demonstrations, and the numbers they publish every time are higher than the actual statistics of the police.

The opposition wants to influence policy formulation through street actions, which should never be encouraged.\n\nIn the coming period, the Hong Kong opposition will intensify various protests and even \"disobedience\" activities to strive for the central government to make concessions that break through the Basic Law around Hong Kong's political reform.

That event centered on a flag-raising ceremony \u2014 but the civic unrest forced officials to take the rare step of moving most of the celebration indoors, where leaders and VIPs watched as the flag was raised on TV, as the Morning Post reports.\nIn an earlier clash, police had redirected protesters who tried to march toward the celebration venue, according to The Associated Press.\nWeeks of massive protests had already forced Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam to apologize and suspend the extradition bill, which would allow Hong Kong people accused of certain crimes to be tried in mainland Chinese courts. But activists say that's not enough. Lacking faith in Beijing-backed Lam, they renewed calls for direct democracy in Hong Kong. \nPro-democracy activists and lawmakers issued a statement on Monday in which they listed their demands. They range from the complete withdrawal of the extradition bill to a call for Lam to resign.  \nPublished by the organization the Civil Human Rights Front, the list also includes three demands related to the protests themselves. The activists are seeking an inquiry into the police use of force during the demonstrations, as well as a retraction by officials who have called the protests \"riots.\" And they want all protesters who were arrested to be released.\nAs Lam spoke on Monday, she repeated her admission that she had not handled the legislation well. She devoted nearly all of her speech to discussing ways in which she would try to improve, saying her government wants to restore public confidence.\n\"After this incident, I will learn the lesson and ensure that the Government's future work will be closer and more responsive to the aspirations, sentiments and opinions of the community,\" Lam said. \"The first and most basic step to take is to change the Government's style of governance to make it more open and accommodating.\"\nThe extradition controversy has also fed concerns among Hong Kongers that their civil liberties are being eroded to the same conditions that exist in mainland China.\n\"China has no freedom. And even Hong Kong now has no freedom,\" a 72-year-old protest supporter named Mrs. Luo told NPR's McCarthy. \"They have lengthened their arms to Hong Kong.\"\nAnother protester, 17-year-old Megan Lee, said she had not previously been politically minded \u2014 though the dispute over the extradition bill has changed that. \"\nThere's more anger that builds up inside of me around these issues,\" Lee told Adrian Ma of member station WBUR. \"And if I have a chance to express it, I feel like now is a chance to take that.\" Ma reports that the young protester \"says she wants to speak up now, because she's not sure she'll have the right to in the future.\"\nAs night fell Monday, thousands of protesters kept marching in Hong Kong, holding their cellphones in the air and using the phone screens to light up the streets.", "translation": "", "uid": "02_00_196", "input": "protesters march toward the celebration venue.

Several scenes on 1st July 2019, one of the monumental days of the protest movement, can help you tell the differences,\u201d he said.\nThe tweet continued: \u201cThe protesters had a very clear understanding of what they were targeting, they only damaged the symbols representing the authoritarian regime.\u201d Law added, \u201cThe protesters who entered the building were civilized and well-mannered. They were fighting for a better society and social justice. They were demanding an unelected government to implement a fair and open electoral system.\u201d\nSeveral pro-democracy protesters within Hong Kong also spoke to VOA, giving their reaction.\nTwenty-seven-year-old Hong Kong resident Aaron -- who asked that only his first name be used, for fear of being arrested -- said \u201cBeijing has always played a game of \u2018whataboutism\u2019 when it comes to international politics.

Article 23 in the Basic Law\u2014the mini-constitution of Hong Kong after 1997\u2014says that the Hong Kong government would enact and legislate this kind of anti-subversive law through the Hong Kong legislative council, which is not totally democratic but half of it is elected democratically. It has some kind of legitimacy and it is nominally autonomous from the Chinese government. Trying to pass an anti-subversion law there at least has the pretension of local autonomy, of \"one country, two systems.\"\nIn 2003, there was a popular backlash with massive protest and international outcry, and the government backed down. This time, the Chinese government is so desperate that they no longer trust the local Hong Kong government, including Beijing allies, to do the job. They fear the same thing will happen again, like the [2019] extradition bill. The bill allowed people in Hong Kong to be arrested and transferred to mainland Chinese court, which is not a rule-of-law system, and the government shelved the bill because of the popular protest.\nSo the Chinese government gave up all hope on letting the Hong Kong local government do this anti-subversion law itself and took this very extreme step to legislate directly in Beijing in secret. The whole world and Hong Kong people didn't know about what the law contains until it was announced and became effective. It is done in Beijing in secret and imposed from Beijing. It skipped even the pretensions of one country two system and local autonomy of Hong Kong. It is a game changer.\nYes\u2014they actually militarized the Hong Kong police with all this military-grade gear and tactics, which is quite similar with police forces around the world nowadays. Like I said, the Hong Kong government inherited laws from the colonial era to deal with protests, and Beijing doesn't worry about protests themselves. What they worry about is the strong public support of the protests. That caught Beijing by surprise last year because in 2014, even a peaceful occupation movement invoked public opinion backlash against it at the end, and the pro-establishment politicians didn't do very badly in the election after that. Meaning that Beijing could take comfort that existing laws can deal with protest and the public opinion in Hong Kong would turn away from protesters in the end.\n", "translation": "", "uid": "02_00_200", "input": "The Hong Kong government arrest people for so - called illegally assembling, protesting, and gathering. they arrest people for the articles they write, for the speeches they make, and for merely knowing and having connections with people that are deemed subversive to the government. the Hong Kong government enact this kind of anti - subversive law through the Hong Kong legislative council, which is not totally democratic but half of it is elected democratically.

On the second floor, the building's CCTV was destroyed, suspected to be by violent demonstrators to avoid being photographed. The wall was cut open and the network cables were cut in a very \"professional\" manner. The above-mentioned Legislative Council staff member said that it is difficult to believe that this kind of method was done by ordinary students.

They described July 1 this year as \"the darkest day in the 176-year history of the Legislative Council.\" They condemned the attack, destruction and insult on the Legislative Council that day, which completely exceeded the bottom line of a society governed by the rule of law. They stressed that expressing opinions must not go beyond the law and the Basic Law. \u300bThe bottom line cannot shake the foundation of \"one country, two systems\".\nThe four major chambers of commerce, including the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce of Hong Kong, the Chinese Manufacturers' Federation of Hong Kong, the Federation of Hong Kong Industries and the Chinese Import and Export Chamber of Commerce of Hong Kong, issued the strongest condemnation on the 3rd for the violent actions that attacked the Legislative Council, expressing their full support for the SAR government and the police to take action in accordance with the law as soon as possible. Restoring social order and public tranquility, and pursuing responsibilities in accordance with the law.

As such, it surely represents the people - or, at least, is supposed to, and thus should be treated as an august place for rational debate.

In many other places, of course, the police are far more heavy-handed than ours, when attacked by a mob. But our Hong Kong protesters are, for the most part, non-violent, which is much to their credit. All the more unfortunate, then, that a minority of them use violence and vandalism to try to make their point.\n\nThat a few hundred extreme protesters are prepared to violently tackle our police, to hurl verbal insults and dangerous objects at them, to attack them with laser lights and corrosive substances, to smash their way into government buildings, to vandalize public property, to trash LegCo, and even to beat up those citizens who oppose them, is sickening to observe. When protests become so violent, they stray from being a legitimate expression of grievance toward dangerous anarchy, and it diminishes the message they are trying to convey. It should be condemned by all.\n\nThe smashing-up of LegCo should be a source of deep shame, as are the violent attacks on our police force members, who are thereby placed in the invidious position of keeping the peace when the more extreme protesters want to do exactly the opposite. Causing damage to the LegCo building achieves nothing for those who demand more democracy. Indeed, strengthening the representative nature of the make-up of LegCo itself would be a viable way forward, once the physical damage, caused by protester vandalism, has been repaired. So, instead of smashing it up, LegCo should be empowered.\n\nThe CE has already correctly indicated a way forward - more dialogue, more explaining, more consultations, more listening - and we will likely see an end of these more extreme protests once that really happens.", "translation": "", "uid": "02_06_186", "input": "by hundreds of young protesters break into Hong Kong's Legislative Council building. their trash of the place. the CE promise more dialogue. young men fight with the police. by a mob attack the police. a minority of them use violence and vandalism to try to make their point. a few hundred extreme protesters hurl verbal insults and dangerous objects at them. a few hundred extreme protesters attack them with laser lights and corrosive substances. a few hundred extreme protesters smash their way. a few hundred extreme protesters vandalize public property. a few hundred extreme protesters beat those citizens who oppose them up. those demand more democracy."}

Since June, violent protesters have been attacking the Hong Kong police, who took action to control the situation, according to the law, but were accused by protesters and Western media of police brutality and abuse of power. Each time a confrontation occurs, accusations of violence by the police are often more stringent than the mobs' irrational acts. Is this an accurate claim? Tom Fowdy, a British political and international relations analyst who lived in Hong Kong, shares his views with CGTN.\n\nThere's an underlining narrative, from the protests and their key figures, that when you see the scenes of violence in Hong Kong, it is apparently the police that provoke them to do that. They claimed that it is a means of self defense. But, honestly, once you look at the evidence in its practical terms, this just makes no sense.\n\nIt's not just a battle between activists and the police. We've seen how the most violent demonstrators have openly targeted properties and businesses that they deem to be \"pro-Beijing\". They have destroyed Xiaomi stores. They have destroyed Bank of China branches. They have intentionally started fires and destroyed transport infrastructure because it is linked to the authorities. We have seen growing attacks on Chinese mainlanders present in the city. We've seen a man set on fire. There's an elderly gentleman who's now passed away after a brick being thrown off his head.\n\nThe idea that this violence is justifiable and encapsulated in the scope of retaliation to police activities is absolutely ludicrous. And it more resembles an all embracing hatred and pursuit of everything linked to the Chinese mainland. It's just not a justifiable defense.\n\nWhen I lived in Hong Kong, it was quite evident that there was an underlying prejudice against the Chinese mainland. It wasn't just a political prejudice against it; it was social prejudice too.\n\nAs the violence continues escalating, this social prejudice is finding its way into the various conflicts and confrontations taking part. For example, simply speaking mandarin in front of the demonstrators can be grounds for immediate suspicion and confrontation, even if you're on their side.\n\nBecause the movement is driven by a completely irrational and unrestrained hatred for the Chinese mainland, this means that the people themselves are simply not safe.

But Beijing\u2019s shadow is already looming over Hong Kong, as locals fear the rapid erosion of their rights. One of those fears, a controversial extradition bill, was the initial trigger for this year\u2019s unrest. The act, supposedly intended to allow the extradition of serious criminals to other countries, was widely seen as a backdoor way of targeting dissidents for deportation to the mainland. These fears were worsened by the repeated kidnapping of Hong Kong citizens, especially booksellers, who sold volumes that have been banned in the mainland by the Chinese security services.\nThe protests soon took on a wider aspect. Hong Kong is an unusual example of rights without democracy; although the city has a long-standing independent judiciary and well-established freedom of speech and protest, it has never had full democracy. The British set up a partial system before leaving, one maintained by the Chinese authorities. Under it, Hong Kongers have a limited ability to vote for their own local assembly, but the bulk of seats are controlled by what are known as \u201cfunctional constituencies\u201d\u2014small groups of elites heavily under Beijing\u2019s thumb.\nThe chief executive position is also chosen by a group of just 1,200 people and signed off on by Beijing. The current chief executive, Carrie Lam, has been an utter failure in her role, with her popularity numbers plummeting to record lows\u2014but Chinese President Xi Jinping has kept her in office, and there\u2019s no straightforward method for her removal. Behind all this, too, is a deeper crisis of identity. While a decade ago as many as 30 percent of Hong Kongers under age 30 identified as Chinese, that figure is now just 3.1 percent.\nAlthough the extradition bill has now been formally withdrawn, protesters\u2019 demands have broadened, now mostly focusing around police violence.

In these instances, the protesters have moved in and immediately began hamstringing public order by building barricades, unlawfully occupying property, and causing criminal damage, meaning the police inevitably have to respond with force to uphold the law as specified.\n\nYet in doing so, the protesters then play the victim and retaliate with the view of accusing the police of being overly violent. Repeatedly, the charge of unlawful assembly and rioting are misrendered as \"political\" when they are in fact, a legal issue.\n\nWe learn from this that some demonstrators want to have their cake and eat it too. They reserve for themselves a right to break the law, but then claim oppression when the police respond in line with legal procedures.\n\nYet as I observed, providing there are no provocations in peaceful protests the police do not engage with the crowd at all. They let it be, and on numerous more occasions too.\n\nThus, in the midst of this all, there is a wider propagated set of myths that the police are constantly stifling all protests in the city and they are the ones turning things violent.

Here\u2019s what you need to know.\n1. Protesters want the government to withdraw a controversial extradition bill.\nThere\u2019s widespread opposition to an extradition bill the Hong Kong government announced earlier this year \u2013 which would allow for extradition requests from authorities in mainland China, Taiwan and Macau for suspects accused of criminal wrongdoing, such as murder and rape.\nDebate over Hong Kong\u2019s proposed extradition law devolves into a scuffle in the legislative council\nHong Kong officials claim that Hong Kong courts will have the final say in whether to grant such extradition requests \u2013 and that people accused of political and religious crimes will not be extradited.\nHowever, many in Hong Kong worry that Beijing may overrule these promises, and they also have concerns about the fairness of China\u2019s legal system. According to a survey of nearly 1,050 residents conducted from May 23 to June 5, about 58 percent disagreed or strongly disagreed that extradited people would receive fair trials in Chinese courts, whereas 15 percent agreed or strongly agreed that they would. More than 47 percent opposed or strongly opposed the extradition legislation, while less than 24 percent supported or strongly supported it.\nDespite the public\u2019s concerns, the Hong Kong government continued to push ahead on the extradition measure. Without other options to stop the legislation, Hong Kong residents turned to a familiar method \u2013 social protests. The first protest occurred on March 31, followed by a second on April 28. After the June 9 mass protest and the violent confrontation between the police and protesters outside the Legislative Council on June 12, Chief Executive Carrie Lam on June 18 apologized for the \u201canxiety\u201d behind the extradition measure and reiterated that the legislature would postpone the measure.\n2. How are these protests different?\nHong Kong\u2019s current protests are reminiscent of 2003, when half a million people marched against national security proposals related to Article 23 of the Basic Law, and succeeded in forcing the government to table the legislation.\nThere\u2019s a new chapter in Hong Kong\u2019s struggle for democracy and autonomy\nBut the \u201cOccupy Central\u201d protests, which evolved into Hong Kong\u2019s Umbrella Movement five years ago, did not result in a similar victory. On Aug. 31, 2014, Chinese central authorities refused to endorse universal suffrage of the Hong Kong chief executive. These protests lasted nearly 80 days, but ultimately failed to wrest concessions from Beijing \u2013 Hong Kong legislators and a select group of business, union, academic, and other leaders choose the chief executive.", "translation": "", "uid": "02_00_212", "input": "the government withdraw a controversial extradition bill. the Hong Kong government push on the extradition measure ahead.

Because an academic paper has strict requirements on method and data sources and must undergo anonymous review, the accuracy of the facts disclosed in this academic paper is no less accurate than a news report, or even more accurate than a news report.\nFrom this, we can see how the West is deeply involved in social movements in other countries and regions and provokes social unrest in other countries. In the form of an academic paper, the author describes the United States' instigation, instigation, and participation in organizing social movements in other countries and regions. A more accurate description. Three points can be seen:\nFirst, the violent social movements in Hong Kong and many other places have foreign masterminds.\nSecond, the United States and the West are organized, premeditated, methodological, funded, and involved in inciting color revolution social violence in other places.\nThird, we can see that the distorted values \u200b\u200band morals of the United States and the West actually regard inciting riots in other countries as a glorious mission, and do so openly and openly, to the point of cognitive confusion, obsession, and pride instead of shame.\nLu Xiang, a researcher at the Institute of American Studies of the Academy of Social Sciences, told reporters that similar papers would not be allowed to be published if they were used for domestic political research in the United States. Because this article involves some data on society as a whole, it falls under the category of national security and should be subject to strict laws and regulations.\nObviously, there will be various dissatisfactions in any society, but no country will allow such dissatisfaction to turn into political riots. Such a paper, to put it bluntly, provides a social psychological basis for organizing political protests in disguise.\nThe publication of such articles shows that the United States only cares about its own stability, completely ignores the stability of other countries and regions, and even hopes that some target countries will be unstable. The United States has a long tradition of engaging in \"color revolutions\" abroad, and has a complete set of methods to guide them. Under the guidance of this method, various sporadic dissatisfactions in society can easily aggregate into political and thematic dissatisfaction. Lu Xiang calls it \"horizontal\" mobilization, which gathers dissatisfaction from all corners under one banner.\nOn the other hand, this paper also reflects that before the introduction of the Hong Kong National Security Law, Hong Kong society had a serious lack of security for a long period of time.

The next day, Lam apologized and offered to \"accept all criticism\" and \"serve the public\".\n\nBut the demonstrations did not stop.\n\nPaul Yeung, a Hong Kong-based researcher and commentator on public policy, said the protests against the extradition bill have morphed into demonstrations against the local government's manner of responding to public opinion.

Quickly arrest and prosecute the rioters who broke into the LegCo to get the message through to the people that peaceful demonstration is one thing, but violence is something to be abhorred. It will bring down the full force of the law on the people involved. It should also state in unequivocal terms, that the extradition bill will be withdrawn from debate. Though Carrie Lam's statement on Tuesday morning has said there was no plan for the debate of that bill in the current LegCo agenda, and the proposed debate of that bill will lapse with the end of the present session of the LegCo, which means in effect the law has been withdrawn from debate, then why not make it explicit that the proposed law has been withdrawn? This is especially relevant given that China's ambassador to the United Kingdom, Liu Xiaoming, in an interview with BBC on June 13, openly stated that the Chinese government rejected the claim that Beijing had a hand in that bill. More importantly, the Hong Kong government should think of how to tackle that vision of \"doomsday\" and lack of hope among the young.\n\nFor the Hong Kong people, they should be wary of being used by outside forces in influencing their actions, always bear in mind that the use of violence is not conducive to winning their argument for the preservation of their way of life. Remember, the 50-year agreement has only another 28 years to go. There is every reason to believe Beijing wants Hong Kong to succeed, for that will make it easier to persuade Taiwan to rejoin the fold, and Taiwan is the bigger prize for Beijing. However, if Hong Kong is seen to be too unruly, or worse, that it is used by foreign powers to subvert China, that special administrative region status might not be renewed. That's the Sword of Damocles hanging over the head of Hong Kong. If Hong Kong really wants to maintain its way of life, learn the process of \"Finlandization\". Finland, once a part of the Soviet empire, gained its independence after the war. It is a democratic and free country, and runs on a market economy. It has a policy of never criticizing the Soviet Union, and has never voted once against the Soviet Union in the United Nations. In other words, it avoids irritating the Soviet Union or having such lofty ideas like bringing democracy to the Soviet Union. It just minds its own business.\n\nJuly 1, 2019 will be remembered as a day of shame in Hong Kong when the peaceful demonstrations in days before turned into riotous acts of hooliganism and rampant destruction of the LegCo through the irresponsible actions of a minority of protesters, the vast majority of them having demonstrated peacefully earlier in the day to register their disagreements with the SAR government.", "translation": "", "uid": "02_06_111", "input": "the rioters break into the LegCo. by outside forces use they in influencing their actions. by foreign powers use it to subvert China.

Police wanted the march to end earlier in Hong Kong\u2019s Wan Chai district, but organizers said that would leave out many people who planned to join the march along the way.\nPolice estimated that 190,000 people joined the peaceful march, the third major one in as many weeks.

The group disbanded last September and is currently facing subversion charges under the security law.\nBut the notable turnout in 2003 \u2013 when some 530,000 Hongkongers filled the streets to oppose the enactment of a security law \u2013 left many believing the iconic march only began that year. The new organisers \u2013 the CHRF \u2013 emerged as a prominent protest coalition in the years that followed. \nDissatisfaction with the government, under the leadership of Tung Chee-hwa, had reached a tipping point when the authorities announced plans in September 2002 to pass Article 23 of the Basic Law, which would allow it to enact laws against treason, secession, sedition and other national security offences. It sparked fears among pro-democracy activists that civil liberties could be negatively threatened. \nTogether with economic recession in the aftermath of the SARS epidemic, CHRF estimated that over half a million people joined its march, with many calling for Article 23 to be axed and for Tung to step down. Some held protest slogans printed by the pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily, which also folded in June 2021 following national security arrests of senior staff and a raid on its newsroom. \nPolice estimated at least 350,00 people had participated in the march, local media reported at the time. Over a year later, Tung resigned. \nOne year after the historic 2003 rally, the turnout for the 2004 demonstration was estimated to be even higher by organisers, who said some 530,000 people hit the streets. But the figure was disputed by scholars, with some saying only around 400,000 turned up. The Public Opinion Programme at the University of Hong Kong (HKUPOP) also gave a much lower estimate of 193,500, while police said 200,000 people attended. \n", "translation": "", "uid": "02_00_47", "input": "some 530,000 Hongkongers fill the streets. the notable turnout in 2003 \u2013 when some 530,000 Hongkongers filled the streets to oppose the enactment of a security law leave many believing the iconic march only began that year. the authorities pass Article 23 of the Basic Law, which would allow it to enact laws against treason, secession, sedition and other national security offences.

But the judge challenged his arguments, saying he had hugged a protester before leaving the chamber as an expression of support.\n\"His intention of entering the legislature is obvious, it is to join this riot,\" he said.\nEarlier, the court heard that defendant Lam Kam-kwan, who was convicted of rioting and a separate charge of criminal damage Thursday, had been detained in mainland China in August 2019 and had been forced to write a repentance letter.

It became a special administrative region of China, operating under the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d model, which allowed for autonomous governance. As Frontline (July 25, 1997) described it, the event was \u201cawaited with trepidation and excitement since 1984, when Britain and China agreed on the terms of the transfer of power\u201d.\nSince then, Hong Kong has witnessed periods marked by economic instability and pro-democracy protests, even as China has attempted to strengthen its hold on the international financial hub through political and legal reforms.\nOne of the significant developments in recent years was the extension of the country\u2019s national security laws to Hong Kong. Enacted in June 2020 by China\u2019s National People\u2019s Congress (NPC), the legislation increased the Chinese government\u2019s influence in the region by granting its security agencies the ability to operate publicly in the city for the first time.\nThe West, whom China has long suspected of provoking \u201csecessionist\u201d sentiments in Hong Kong, was quick to criticise this decision. The NPC, on its part, justified the move, saying it was taken to safeguard \u201cnational security\u201d and Hong Kong\u2019s \u201clong-term stability and prosperity.\u201d\nSome countries also pointed out that this law directly contradicted Beijing\u2019s promise, made during the handover, to safeguard Hong Kong\u2019s civil liberties and freedom for 50 years until 2047. But it is worth asking whether the British imperialists ever allowed Hong Kong to function as anything akin to what these countries perceive as \u201cWestern-style democracy\u201d in the years prior to the transfer of power.\nNow, 26 years after the Hong Kong handover, Frontline has compiled a collection of articles shedding light on Hong Kong\u2019s initial years after the handover, its economic struggles, the movements for electoral reform and autonomy, and its leadership over the years.\nHappy reading.", "translation": "", "uid": "02_00_105", "input": "the \u201c one country, two systems \u201d model allow for autonomous governance. by China \u2019s National People \u2019s Congress ( NPC ) enact the legislation.

If there is a Chinese state-owned company on the Hong Kong stock market and a journalist reports about its accounting fraud, that can potentially become a subversive act, according to the law.\nThat happened to journalists in mainland China when they published on some wrongdoing or corruption of powerful, politically well-connected enterprises. The journalists were shut down and arrested for these kinds of national security charges all the time. During the early outbreak of COVID-19, doctors whistleblowing about the virus and defying the government effort to cover it up were deemed subversive, too. Recently, the HSBC has been fiercely attacked by Chinese media and officials, not only for not backing the national security law initially, but also for jeopardizing China's national security, as it abided by a U.S. law enforcement request to hand in information about its Chinese client to assist in an U.S. investigation into a fraudulent case involving Huawei, a very important high-tech firm in China allegedly linked to the military.\nOr look at what constitutes promotion of separatism\u2014that is very vague too. You might remember the case in which United Airlines and Marriot listed Taiwan, Hong Kong, and China as separate destinations or locations in their websites. Then they were accused of promoting Taiwan and Hong Kong independence by doing it.\nThese kinds of cases show how broad Beijing can apply these political charges to businesses and ordinary people far beyond the circle of dissidents and activists. Everybody will be at risk. That is why international business associations, including the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, are expressing concerns. Hong Kong is a financial center that hinges on not only rule of law, but also the freedom of information.\nChina is going to, and I think they're readying to, pay a high economic price for doing it. Hong Kong has been useful to mainland China because the whole world treats Hong Kong as a separate entity from mainland China in terms of trade, in terms of export control, in terms of immigration. Hong Kong has a separate membership in the WTO from China. Hong Kong's legal system has been in line with the Common Law tradition in Western countries. It has been an offshore financial hub where a lot of Chinese companies raise capital in the Hong Kong capital market.\nHong Kong is really the global gateway for China because of the legal infrastructures and the people's trust in the fairness and flow of information. People do business there and settle business disputes there. Now, international businesses are thinking about relocating to other places. Hong Kong's special status and special role has a lot to do with U.S. policy to recognize Hong Kong as a separate economic entity, a separate custom territory, from mainland China on the condition that Hong Kong is sufficiently autonomous from Beijing. Now that the State Department of the U.S. has declared that they no longer can treat Hong Kong as separate from mainland China, they are going to revoke a lot of trading privileges Hong Kong has. Most recently, the State Department declared that the U.S. no longer exempts Hong Kong from its export control regime, which bans or heavily regulates the export of high tech equipment and software, covering a lot of things\u2014high-performance computer chips, optical fiber, and engineering software\u2014that have U.S. components to China. Chinese high-tech companies have been using Hong Kong as a kind of a backdoor to get a hold of these hardware, software, and equipment. There will be a major setback to China's high tech ambition when the U.S. finally shuts this backdoor.\nAnd financially, we will see what the U.S. government will do to put financial sanctions on Hong Kong.", "translation": "", "uid": "02_00_202", "input": "by Chinese media and officials attack the HSBC.

He stormed the Legislative Council with Yau Wai-chen and three other people. He was charged with participating in illegal assembly and was sentenced to four weeks in prison in 2018. He was later released on bail pending appeal.\nAccording to Hong Kong's \"Eastern Net\" news, today (September 2), the Hong Kong High Court rejected Liang Songheng's appeal, and he must be imprisoned immediately to serve his sentence. The judge believed that the conviction was not unsafe and the sentence was not obviously excessive, so he dismissed his appeal application.\nIn 2016, then-Legislative Council members Leung Chung-hang and Yau Wai-chen displayed \"Hong Kong Independence\" slogans and altered their oaths while taking the oath, and were ruled to have lost their qualifications as members. The two are both members of the \"Youth New Deal\", a \"Hong Kong independence\" organization.\nOn November 2 of the same year, he, together with You Huizhen and three assistants, forced their way into the Legislative Council conference room. Leung Chung-hang and Yau Wai-ching were charged with using \"extreme force\" to enter the Legislative Council conference room on the day of the incident, and were involved in the crime of participating in an illegal assembly.\nIn May 2018, Hong Kong's Kowloon City Magistrates' Court convicted Leung Chung-hang and sentenced him to four weeks in prison. Subsequently, Liang Songheng was granted bail and appealed to the Hong Kong High Court, requesting to overturn the conviction and apply for a commutation of sentence. In June this year, the Court of First Instance of the Hong Kong High Court opened a hearing on the case.\nOn September 2, the court officially rejected Liang Songheng\u2019s appeal application, and he was therefore required to serve his sentence in prison immediately. Judge Chan Ka-Shing of the Court of First Instance believed that the conviction by the Kowloon City Magistrates' Court was not unsafe and the sentence was not obviously excessive, so he dismissed his appeal application.\nBarrister Kenneth Kwok, who represents Leung Chung-heng, said he plans to appeal to the Court of Final Appeal.\nIt is worth mentioning that when Leung Chung-hang and Yau Wai-chen were ruled to have lost their membership qualifications in 2016, they had only been in office for 12 days, but they had already received one month's parliamentary salary of about HK$90,000 each, and more than HK$830,000 in advance operating funds.\nThe Administrative Committee of the Hong Kong Legislative Council (AC) filed with the District Court in 2017 and 2018 to recover the above-mentioned amounts from the two people. In May 2020, the Hong Kong court ruled that the two must return a total of approximately NT$1.86 million in salary and advances to the ACAC, and pay the ACAC\u2019s legal fees.\nYou Huizhen's proposal to repay in installments was accepted. She will repay HK$25,000 per month in 48 installments. Liang Songheng still ignored it. On August 18, the Administration Commission filed a petition with the Hong Kong High Court to make Leung Chung Hang bankrupt. \"Eastern Net\" quoted the Legislative Council Secretariat as saying that this is the first time that the ACCM has submitted a bankruptcy petition to an individual.", "uid": "02_06_62", "input": "He storm the Legislative Council.

Officers grabbed the cart after it became wedged in the broken glass and repelled the protesters with pepper spray.\nFive hours later, protesters smashed more windows and dismantled a towering metal grate protecting a section of the building, which was ordered closed and workers sent home.\nThe actions prompted march organizers to change the endpoint of their protest from the legislature to a nearby park, after police asked them to either call it off or change the route. Police wanted the march to end earlier in the Wan Chai district, but organizers said that would leave out many people who planned to join the march along the way.\nHong Kong has been wracked by weeks of protests over a government attempt to change extradition laws to allow suspects to be sent to China to face trial.

The Department of Justice believes that immediate imprisonment is the only appropriate sentence for each defendant, and the maximum sentence for illegal assembly under summary procedure is three years. He believed the court should consider the sentence at the \"upper middle end\" of the maximum possible sentence.\n\nThe case continued this morning.

It contravenes the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which is incorporated into Hong Kong\u2019s legal framework via the Basic Law and expressed in the Bill of Rights Ordinance. The covenant guarantees people\u2019s rights to expression, information, association, and peaceful assembly, and rights to participate in public affairs, vote, and be a candidate for public office. It also ensures criminal suspects\u2019 right to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial court.\n\nCriminalization of Peaceful Speech, Activities\n\nThe National Security Law punishes four types of activities: secession (arts. 20-21), subversion (arts. 22-23), terrorism (arts. 24-28), and collusion with \u201cforeign forces\u201d (arts. 29-30), all carrying a maximum sentence of life in prison. Article 35 also states that anyone convicted of crimes under the law will be deprived of the right to run for public office for life.\n\nThe definitions of these crimes are overly broad and vague. \u201cSubversion,\u201d for example, criminalizes any act that seriously \u201cinterferes,\u201d \u201cdisrupts,\u201d or \u201cundermines\u201d the functioning of the Chinese or Hong Kong governments, a definition that can readily include peaceful protests. Both the crimes of \u201csecession\u201d and \u201csubversion\u201d make criminal acts that do not involve \u201cforce or threat of force,\u201d meaning that peaceful actions, such as speeches advocating these ideas, can violate the law.\n\nMainland authorities have long used these vague crimes against people in China for promoting human rights. For example, the late Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo was sentenced to 11 years in prison for \u201cinciting subversion\u201d after he organized a joint letter calling for political reforms.", "translation": "", "uid": "02_00_66", "input": "by the Chinese government impose The National Security Law.

First, the decision to reject universal suffrage in 2014 came from Beijing, while the Hong Kong legislature proposed the extradition bill, reportedly without instructions from Beijing. The 2014 movement sought broader political rights, whereas the 2019 protests aimed to defend the status quo.\nSecond, the Umbrella Movement involved well-known protest leaders or activists, some of whom have been put behind bars. The recent protests were initiated by the Civil Rights Front, though with the permission of the police. These protests were based on people\u2019s voluntary participation, and they reflect the wide consensus on the need to take action among the population.\n3. What happens now?\nHong Kong\u2019s recurring protests reflect the challenges the legislature faces in accommodating local interests, as well as the interests of Beijing. Hong Kong since 1997 has been a Special Administrative Region of China, and its Basic Law provides for the special \u201cone country two systems\u201d rule.\nBeijing retains the power to choose Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, which means this leader must answer to the Chinese government. But Beijing\u2019s interests are not always in line with those of local residents. When the central government attempts to exercise stricter control over Hong Kong, the attempt is at odds with local residents\u2019 strong will to protect their freedom.\nAs the indirect election system does not fully reflect the public\u2019s preference, the people lack effective institutionalized channels of political participation. Protests remain an important way to express views and protect political rights in Hong Kong. And, importantly, protests have time and again proven to be effective \u2013 and do not require much mobilization partly because of the free flow of information.\nAnalysts see Beijing forced to balance between protecting Hong Kong\u2019s role as an international financial center and maintaining Chinese political control. But Beijing has not always repressed popular demands in Hong Kong \u2013 Beijing appeared to be more compromising than Lam, who pursued the legislation unwaveringly in recent months. Lam changed her approach on June 15, reportedly after she had met with Han Zheng, a standing member of the Chinese Politburo in charge of Hong Kong matters, in Shenzhen.\nWhy China\u2019s May Fourth celebrations also bring new concerns for Beijing.\nMany in Hong Kong seem to find it difficult to forgive Lam for taking a hard line on the extradition issue, and for how she interacted with the resentful public. Many citizens rejected her June 18 public apology for mishandling the extradition bill \u2013 prompting calls for her to step down. An online survey of 166,000 people that week showed that 76 percent did not think that Lam should continue to be the chief executive.\nThis public resentment will likely persist over the next three years \u2013 if Lam stays to finish her term. For Lam, it may prove essential to maintain both goodwill and political wisdom to obtain the public\u2019s forgiveness.\nFor the Chinese government, the next big worry may turn out to be Hong Kong\u2019s 2020 legislative election. If pro-democracy legislators manage to claim a majority, there could be significant changes in the political landscape in Hong Kong.", "translation": "", "uid": "02_00_213", "input": "the 2019 protests defend the status quo. the Umbrella Movement involve well - known protest leaders or activists, some of whom have been put behind bars.

They were looking for confrontation and succeeded in causing massive criminal damage to the complex through wanton vandalism.\n\nIt was most unfortunate that the world's media and politicians have refused to acknowledge that the invasion of the complex was a riotous act and not simply a protest demonstration. In order to uphold the rule of law in Hong Kong, it's vital that those arrested should be prosecuted for their criminal acts as they were definitely not there just to protest, but to perpetrate unlawful activities.\n\nThe use of force to invade and occupy the complex was unlike that directed in central London at the Extinction Rebellion group's climate change protesters, who adopted a non-violent civil disobedience approach in April to promote their cause.\n\nDespite the peaceful, yet disruptive nature of the protest, more than 1,000 people were arrested as a result.", "translation": "", "uid": "02_06_191", "input": "protesters smash up the legislature. force occupy the complex."}

The city maintains distinct and independent rule of law to China as part of that framework.\n    \n\n            Protesters also want to end characterizations of earlier protests as riots, and have called for the creation of an independent commission to look into accusations of police brutality.\n    \n\n            Many protesters are still angry over police use of tear gas and rubber bullets to force people off the streets on June 12, when protesters successfully blocked off the city\u2019s legislature and prevented lawmakers from debating the extradition bill. \n    \n\n            Beijing said on Monday that Britain has no responsibility toward the former colony and must stop interfering in what is a Chinese domestic affair.

That would be another major blow to Chinese business ambitions to expand overseas.\nIn some ways I can't tell which is the cause and which is the effect, but definitely U.S.-Chinese relations have been deteriorating not only over Hong Kong, but over all kinds of issues\u2014high tech, trade, Taiwan. This national security law is just another point of contention, creating another reason or excuse for the U.S. to escalate its actions against China and vice versa. Hong Kong has been very important in, for example, the Huawei case, in which its CFO and the daughter of the boss of Huawei was arrested in Canada and might be extradited to the U.S. because she's accused of setting up a subsidiary of Huawei in Hong Kong to import U.S. equipment and transfer it to Iran, violating international and U.S. sanctions.\nHong Kong has been at the epicenter of this U.S.-China conflict lately, and this national security law creates a fairly convenient cover for the U.S. administration to sanction Chinese businesses and enterprises. And, of course, they're concerned about human rights and freedom in Hong Kong too. As has been reported widely, this national security law has the surprising Article 38, which applies the law to non-Hong Kong residents who commit things deemed illegal by the law outside of Hong Kong. Basically everybody in the world, if having said something deemed subversive from a Chinese government point of view, can be found guilty, and if you are in transit via Hong Kong or any other place with extradition arrangements with Hong Kong, you can be potentially at risk of being arrested under this law.\nWell, the protest might die down a little bit but popular opinions and sympathy will still reside with the protestors. And with the distaste for the law, people will fight on in one way or another. Maybe they will go underground, but they will fight on. And now the U.S. is discussing new laws providing priority political refugee pathways for people in Hong Kong persecuted by the law\u2014and also the UK, Australia, Taiwan, other countries are also considering providing a kind of exit route for Hong Kong people to seek refuge.

Among them, six people were charged and appeared in court at the Eastern District Magistrates' Court on the 21st.\n\nIn the early morning of the 19th, radical demonstrators wearing helmets, goggles, masks, and masks violently attacked the Legislative Council building multiple times with iron fences, bricks, drain covers, trash cans, etc. The building was damaged in many places, with glass broken and brick walls broken. The rioters also tried to prevent the police from enforcing the law and provoked the police officers. Three police officers were injured. The Hong Kong SAR government, members of the Legislative Council, and various political groups have condemned the rioters' actions. The police launched a comprehensive investigation and people were arrested one after another.\n\nInformation provided by the police shows that the 11 people arrested so far, ranging in age from 17 to 54, were suspected of \"criminal damage\", \"assaulting a police officer\", \"accessing computers with criminal or dishonest intent\", and \"illegal assembly\" \". Six of them were escorted by police vehicles to the Eastern District Magistrates' Court on the 21st and were charged with \"criminal damage\" and \"assaulting a police officer\" respectively.\n\nWhile the police continue to investigate the case of rioters attacking the Legislative Council building, Hong Kong's illegal \"Occupy Central\" has lasted for 55 days.

In addition, the organizers of the action and some politicians who supported the action distorted the concept of the rule of law and spread the fallacy that there is no need to abide by the law.

smash-up on the 19th. Although 4 of them did not admit which group they belonged to, various investigations showed that they often participated in activities organized by \"Hot-Blooded Citizens\" and should is its member. Among them, the person wearing red clothes and taking the lead in smashing the glass door of the Legislative Council with an iron horse was the host of the \"Hot Blood Times\" who participated in the Mong Kok street forum earlier and was nicknamed \"The French Guy\". According to the report, as early as the beginning of this month, the \"passionate citizens\" were actively planning to \"do a major event that would attract the attention of the whole Hong Kong.\" They stormed the Legislative Council this time because they were unwilling to accept that Mong Kok was about to be cleared, so they went to Admiralty to cause trouble and will The escalation of actions is to arouse public attention on the one hand; on the other hand, it is reaching out to the \"occupied area\" of Admiralty in an attempt to expand its territory. \"Oriental Daily\" stated that members of the \"Hot-Blooded Citizen\" are known as the \"Mask Party\" because they often wear masks in action. The six people arrested were between the ages of 18 and 24. Five of them were cynical young people with low education and addicted to the Internet. One of them had a criminal record for having sex with an underage girl, and the others had no criminal record.\n\n\"Hot-Blooded Citizens\" is an extremely radical group of the Hong Kong opposition. Its founders are pan-democratic Legislative Council member Huang Yu-min (observer website note: has caused incidents such as \"throwing a cup at the Chief Executive\"), Huang Yangda and his wife Chen Xiuhui, etc. They operate the \"Hot Blood Times\" website, online channels and publications, and at the same time host and co-organize a number of \"social activities\" throughout Hong Kong, attracting many \"double losers\" and unemployed people to join. Instigated by Huang Yumin and Huang Yangda, although there are not many of them, it is said that more than 300 people have participated in the \"occupation\" operations in various districts, but they have always played a role in directly confronting the police and instigating violent incidents. Dozens of them are \"death squads\" and \"Stormtrooper\" members generally prepare helmets, goggles, masks, pointed umbrellas, gloves and other equipment. When the \"Occupy Central\" movement broke out on September 28, Huang Yangda stood on a ladder and encouraged demonstrators to continuously attack the police defense line, becoming one of the most active troublemakers at the scene. Although Huang Yangta claimed that he acted independently and had no contact with the Federation of Students, Scholar Thought and the \"Three Ugly Occupy Central\" groups, they coordinated in early October, and the \"passionate citizens\" were mainly responsible for Mong Kok. After the police successfully cleared some roadblocks on Nathan Road in the early morning of October 17, \"hot-blooded citizens\" formed a \"frontline stormtrooper team\" and attacked the police that night and at midnight on the 18th.

"translation": "The network that incites violence\nIn June and July 2019, some anti-extradition law demonstrators in Hong Kong clashed with law enforcement police. Subsequently, the personal and family information of some police officers was made public on the Internet, including the names, ID numbers and families of the police officers and their family members. Address, etc.\nSome police officers said that they and their families received a large number of harassing and threatening calls and text messages. According to statistics, 150 cases were transferred to the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data in a short period of time.\nAmid the turmoil over the amendment bill, some online forums and social media in Hong Kong have become breeding grounds for thugs and classrooms for inciting atrocities, becoming the biggest source of chaos in Hong Kong. Faced with Hong Kong teenagers who have grown up with the Internet and are deeply dependent on it, as long as they seize the right to speak online through various means, constantly cater to their interests and preferences, and stimulate their extremes and hatred, they can trap their hearts and incite them. They roam the streets.\nA survey by the Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups found that nearly 90% of Hong Kong youth own smartphones and use them for an average of 3.5 hours a day. Social media represented by Facebook has become the most commonly used platform by Hong Kong youth, and nearly half of Hong Kong youth use it as the main source of information on public affairs.\nOn social platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube in Hong Kong, rumors are costless and lies are flying everywhere. \"Police sexually assaulted an arrested woman\", \"Police undercover threw incendiary bombs\", \"People died at Prince Edward Station on August 31\"... Internet rumors pushed some young people who did not know what was going on into an inexplicable \"revenge\" mood and lost their rational thinking. and independent judgment. Even if the police and relevant departments provide evidence to prove that the online rumors are completely false, the inciters continue to spread the rumors online and conduct \"memorial\" activities online and offline.\nMalicious subversion and arrogance are the most common means to incite violence and inspire hatred and fear. In August, some maliciously modified pictures and videos were circulated online. An image shows a family being chased by riot police at New Town Plaza in Sha Tin. The video played by the police at the press conference clearly showed that the police were escorting them to a safe place. The family later publicly thanked the police for protecting them.\nIn a video of the demonstration played by the police, a young man suddenly jumped off the bridge, and multiple police officers caught him in time to avoid a tragedy. However, the incident was described online as \"the police pushing the young man off the bridge\".\nViolent instigation is not considered strange on the Internet, and it has even turned into violent and terrorist teaching with a terrorist nature. Social media represented by the \"Lian Deng\" online discussion forum and \"Telegram\" have become the source and command post of \"black terror\" and the base camp for instigating atrocities.\nLog into these two online platforms and you will be flooded with inciting posts. Want to make your own assault weapon and use it correctly? There are graphic or video tutorials here to teach you \"step by step\" how to make and use incendiary bombs, smoke bombs, improvised bombs, and corrosive liquid bombs. In addition, there are \"dog sticks\", bows and arrows, modified slingshots... \"Eighteen kinds of weapons\" used by black-clad thugs when they attack police and siege institutions. You can find \"warfare instruction manuals\" here.\n\"The online public opinion environment in Hong Kong is particularly bad.\" Chen Zhihao, vice chairman of the Hong Kong Youth Current Affairs Commentators Association, felt deeply. \"The opposition is very comfortable on the popular Internet, and all kinds of rumors and slanderous things can be circulated unimpeded.\"", "uid": "02_06_49", "input": "The network incite violence. thugs and classrooms incite atrocities. they incite them. nearly 90 % of Hong Kong youth use them for an average of 3.5 hours a day. by Hong Kong youth use platform. nearly half of Hong Kong youth use it as the main source of information on public affairs.

Officials rejected its application, citing the coronavirus pandemic and violence at previous marches.\nCalls continued online, however, appealing for Hong Kong people to come out and push back against the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s tightening rule and the swift erosion of the city\u2019s once-famous freedoms.\n", "translation": "", "uid": "02_00_92", "input": "police march them away. they arrest 69 people, including two local legislators known as district councilors. groups of protesters, along with regular residents break into chants popularized during street protests last year \u2014 including \u201c Liberate Hong Kong, Revolution of our Times \u201d.

Police officer Ali (pseudonym) and his colleagues were ordered to handle a criminal damage case at Kwun Tong MTR station. Suddenly a sharp blade stuck out from the crowd and stabbed Ali in the neck.\nThe person who injured someone with a knife was actually an 18-year-old sixth form student.\nMore than a month later, Ali sadly told reporters on his hospital bed: \"In the past few months, some college and middle school students have used very violent methods to attack police and citizens, and destroyed shops. I think there is something wrong with Hong Kong's education.\"\nWhen Ali was interviewed by reporters at the Hong Kong Police Headquarters, the wound on his neck was clearly visible (photo taken on November 27, 2019). (Photo by Xinhua News Agency reporter Li Zhen)\nTeenagers are the most enthusiastic group in the turmoil over the extradition bill. They wantonly set fires and vandalism, smashed shops, destroyed public facilities, threw petrol bombs, and attacked police and citizens.\nBut what is ridiculous is that after some of them were punished by the police according to law, some schools not only did not criticize their illegal and violent behavior, but instead issued a statement accusing \"the police of violating regulations and exceeding their authority\" and calling on all walks of life to \"accept\" the violent students.\nThere are many teachers in Hong Kong who incite violence and commit violence. Huang Junyu, president of the Hong Kong Federation of Educators, said that there are more than 60,000 teachers in primary and secondary schools in Hong Kong, including some teachers with more radical ideas. Although they are small in number, they have great energy. They use the platform to carry out political propaganda and persuade some immature young people and even minors to take to the streets. The most violent members among them were trained to be \"brave\" men who did not distinguish right from wrong and despised the law.\nAccording to statistics from the education department of the Hong Kong SAR government, from June last year to the end of January this year, a total of 171 complaints were received about possible professional misconduct by teachers, most of which involved making inappropriate remarks such as hatred and curses. A middle school assistant principal actually cursed that \"a gangster policeman will kill his whole family\" and \"the policeman's children will not survive until the age of seven.\" Public opinion in Hong Kong called this a \"shame on the education sector.\"\nAs the largest single-industry trade union in Hong Kong and the organization with the largest number of participating members, the Hong Kong \"Teachers' Association\" has long been controlled by opposition forces. The leader of the organization, Ye Jianyuan, once expressed support for middle school students in promoting \"Hong Kong independence\" on campus, beautifying it as \"having independent opinions, having personal opinions and caring about current affairs.\"\n\u201cIf Hong Kong\u2019s education is \u2018sick\u2019, then there is something wrong with the educators first.\u201d Gu Minkang, former deputy dean of the School of Law of City University of Hong Kong, wrote in an article.\nIn addition to educators, there are also many problems with teaching content. \"Hong Kong lacks national education with positive guidance, but is full of negative expressions of the opposition and 'education' full of hatred.\" said Deng Fei, principal of Hong Kong Island Secondary School in Tseung Kwan O.", "uid": "02_06_47", "input": "Police officer Ali ( pseudonym ) and his colleagues handle a criminal damage case at Kwun Tong MTR station. who injure someone with a knife. some college and middle school students use very violent methods to attack police and citizens, and destroyed shops. some college and middle school students attack police and citizens. some college and middle school students destroy shops.

Hardly limited to Hong Kong, the phenomenon was a driving force behind the global wave of demonstrations in 2009-12: the Green Movement in Iran, the \"Arab Spring\" in the Middle East, Occupy Wall Street in the United States, and the anti-austerity protests in Portugal, Spain and Greece.\n\nIn his book Networks of Outrage and Hope: Social Movements in the Internet Age, social theorist Manuel Castells argues that such \"multifaceted rebellions\" were driven not so much by poverty, economics, or lack of democracy as by \"the humiliation provoked by the cynicism and arrogance of those in power\".\n\nBut it was only through networking that such emotions were translated into mass action.

The five demands of protesters now focus on investigation of police brutality, pardons for those charged with rioting, and the introduction of full democracy into the city. This last is the greatest sticking point for Beijing, which has no desire to create more trouble for itself and is actively hostile to any polity, like Taiwan, that combines a Chinese inheritance and democracy.\nForeign Policy has been following the tumult since the start. Here are five pieces that sum up the city\u2019s turbulent year.\nby Hilton Yip, May 16\nWriting before the protests had peaked with numbers in the millions, the journalist Hilton Yip predicted the long struggle to come and the damage the extradition bill would do. \u201cMost potently for Hong Kongers, it will mean the erasure of the sense of the city as something different and special\u2014a threat to the values that the regions\u2019 residents have come to hold dear,\u201d he writes. At the core of his argument was the city\u2019s special sense of self. \u201cHong Kong might not be a democracy,\u201d Yip argues, \u201c\u2026 but its people deeply value the rule of law established under the British and still modeled on an independent court system unknown on the mainland.\u201d\nby Milia Hau, June 12\nThe responsibility of Hong Kong\u2019s former colonial owner in creating the conditions for today\u2019s protests was a recurrent theme this year. Milia Hau argued in June that Britain\u2019s failure to establish democracy and properly protect Hong Kong citizens under international law gave the Communist Party the edge. \u201cNaturally and understandably, British nationals (overseas) want British citizenship. In a United Kingdom already torn by immigration issues, handing citizenship to hundreds of thousands of people, however strong the moral case, is a political impossibility,\u201d Hau writes. But, she writes, there are still measures the U.K. could take to help its former subjects.

Should the bill become law, it would further excite violent protesters to take to the streets, sabotaging efforts in recent months by the Hong Kong government to reclaim stability and prosperity.\n\nHong Kong affairs are China's internal affairs. Playing Hong Kong as a card will get the United States nowhere. Should the act eventually become law, it will not only harm China's interests and China-U.S. ties, but also severely undermine the interests of the U.S. firms that depend on the city's social tranquility and economic vitality.\n\nThese self-serving U.S. politicians and treacherous attempts to roil Hong Kong will fail on all fronts.

It was the highest turnout since 2003. Demonstrators again asked Leung to step down, while some waved British colonial flags. The organisers also said the civil disobedience movement Occupy Central was \u201cready to go.\u201d \nIn 2014, Hong Kong saw around 510,000 people join the July 1 march \u2013 the highest turnout in recent years.

Many leading figures including legal scholar Tai and then-student leader Joshua Wong were jailed in the years following the police clearance.\nIn the aftermath of the Umbrella Movement, which resulted in more than 1,000 arrests, the July 1 march turnout plunged to only 48,000 in 2015, organisers estimated. The figure was the lowest since 2008, as Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy movement was at a low ebb, beset with in-fighting and fatigue.\nHKUPOP recorded a turnout of 28,000, while the government said only 20,000 took part in the march.\nWhile the CHRF said the turnout of the July 1 march rose back to 110,000 in 2016, HKUPOP and the authorities reported the showing to be between 20,000 and 30,000. \n", "translation": "", "uid": "02_00_49", "input": "They demand that he step down, on the first day he assumed power. some wave British colonial flags. around 510,000 people join the July 1 march \u2013 the highest turnout in recent years.
