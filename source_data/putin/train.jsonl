Still, Russians heeded a call to protest Putin\u2019s repression and his war in Ukraine by showing up at polling stations at noon Sunday. \nWith all the precincts counted Monday, election officials said Putin had secured a record number of votes, underlining his total control over the political system. U.S. and other Western leaders denounced the election as a sham.\nU.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said there was \u201cnothing free or fair\" about the election but seemingly resisted calls from Russia's opposition to not recognize Putin as the winner.\nAhead of the election, Putin's greatest political foe, Alexei Navalny, died in an Arctic penal colony, anti-war candidates were barred from the ballot and independent voices were silenced in a Kremlin-backed media blockade.

Still, Russians heeded a call to protest Putin\u2019s repression and his war in Ukraine by showing up at polling stations at noon Sunday. \nWith all the precincts counted Monday, election officials said Putin had secured a record number of votes, underlining his total control over the political system. U.S. and other Western leaders denounced the election as a sham.\nU.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said there was \u201cnothing free or fair\" about the election but seemingly resisted calls from Russia's opposition to not recognize Putin as the winner.\nAhead of the election, Putin's greatest political foe, Alexei Navalny, died in an Arctic penal colony, anti-war candidates were barred from the ballot and independent voices were silenced in a Kremlin-backed media blockade. No independent monitoring organizations were able to observe the election and analysts said online polling meant the vote was highly susceptible to manipulation.

But reality has proven that all these predictions have failed.\nElla Pamfilova, chairperson of the Russian Central Election Commission (Central Election Commission), said, \u201cSo far, we have received applications from 16 people to become candidates for the Russian presidency.\u201d The Central Election Commission also stated that Russia will The four regions of Ukraine and the Crimean peninsula under its control held general elections.\nOn December 18, 2023, Putin submitted documents to the Russian Central Election Commission to participate in the 2024 presidential election as an independent candidate and officially registered as a presidential candidate. On March 26, 2000, Putin was officially elected as president. After his first term, Putin served as the president of Russia three times in 2004, 2012, and 2018, taking the helm of this large northern country that spans Europe and Asia."}

March 10, local time, the Russian State Duma (lower house of parliament) passed the second reading of the draft amendment to the Constitution of the Russian Federation (hereinafter referred to as the \"Constitutional Amendment\").\nAccording to RIA Novosti news on March 10, the Russian State Duma held a second reading of the draft amendment to the constitution that day. 382 deputies who participated in the State Duma plenary session voted in favor of the draft, 44 deputies abstained, and no one objected. In preparation for the second reading of the draft, the State Duma received nearly 400 opinions on constitutional amendments regarding state construction and legislation, of which about 200 were taken into consideration.\nOn the 10th, Russian President Vladimir Putin went to the State Duma to deliver a speech, expressing his disagreement with the removal of the limit on the number of Russian presidential terms in the Russian constitution, but also revealed his intention to run for president again after the constitution is revised.\nAccording to RIA Novosti, before Putin arrived at the meeting, Valentina Tereshkova, a member of the \"United Russia Party\" and the world's first female astronaut, proposed that the limit on the number of presidential terms should be removed from the constitutional amendment, or that the limit on the number of presidential terms should be removed. After the constitutional amendment takes effect, the current president's term of office shall be counted from zero.\n\"It is proposed to remove the limit on the number of presidential terms, or to add a clause in the amendment: after the new constitution takes effect, the current president, like other citizens, has the right to run for president of the country.\" Tereshkova said.\nPutin responded by saying that removing presidential term limits from the constitution was unreasonable. In the long run, society should ensure that the change of power occurs, which is necessary for national development.\n\"I believe and am convinced that strong presidential power is absolutely necessary for our country. However, the public should guarantee that elections (including presidential elections) are open and competitive.\" Putin further said.\nAccording to a report by \"Russia Today\" (RT) on the 10th, Putin is not opposed to the possibility of running for president again in 2024. He considered a change of power crucial to Russia's dynamics, but also said that if the amendments are approved by the Constitutional Court, the former head of state should be able to run for office in a new presidential election under the updated constitution. Regarding this idea, Putin emphasized that in the upcoming referendum on April 22, \"only if citizens support such a proposal\" can such a proposal become a reality.\nPutin also said: \"Since the initiative to amend the constitution comes from me, I would like to express my position here. The constitutional amendment has long been mature, and I firmly believe that the amendment will be useful to our citizens, it will strengthen our sovereignty, our traditions and Our values.\" He said he hopes to work together with members of the State Duma to work for the country until 2024, \"and we will see how things develop then.\"\nAccording to previous reports by Russian media, if the second reading goes well, the Russian State Duma will conduct a third reading of the draft constitutional amendment at 10:00 Moscow time on March 11. It will then be voted upon by the Federation Council, followed by approval by two-thirds of the legislative assemblies (local assemblies) of the subjects of the Russian Federation, and then reviewed by the Constitutional Court for specific provisions, and finally submitted to a referendum.\nThe referendum is scheduled for April 22. If more than half of the citizens who vote support it, the constitutional amendment will take effect on the day the voting results are announced.\nPutin proposed amending the constitution when delivering a State of the Union address to both houses of the Russian Parliament on January 15, and a constitutional amendment working group was formed on the same day.

Among them, the plan named \"Fortress Russia\" aims to increase the resilience of Russia's economy and society and further reduce its dependence on the West. In fact, as early as 2005, when relations with the West were still in the \"honeymoon\", a Russian official think tank suggested in a policy document titled \"Fortress Russia\" that an \"isolationist\" policy (and even a world view) that would effectively reduce foreign dependence would be It is feasible in the long run.\n\u201cThe so-called \u2018isolationism\u2019 refers to a mode of national existence in which the government only establishes and maintains relatively limited external contacts."}

incumbent president due to the lack of a real alternative\n\nMOSCOW - Russians went to the polls on Sunday to take part in a presidential election whose outcome few doubted.\n\nEven preliminary results, released shortly after polling stations in the Kaliningrad region closed, showed that incumbent head of state Vladimir Putin had secured victory in an election that critics say was staged.\n\nAccording to the latest data from the Russian Central Election Commission, published this morning in Moscow, Putin received more than 76 percent of the vote - a record result for his entire reign, as announced by Ella Pamfilova, chairman of the Russian Central Election Commission. It is unclear whether the Kremlin succeeded in achieving its goal of raising turnout to 70 percent - according to the latest data from the Russian Central Election Commission, it was 67.7 percent of all Russian voters. However, these data are not yet final, and Kremlin officials insisted that this figure would be achieved after all the calculations.\n\nDuring the voting, there were reports of hundreds of irregularities with ballot papers at polling stations in different parts of the country. Election officials played them down, saying only that the reports were being investigated.\n\nPutin's closest rival, candidate from the Communist Party of the Russian Federation Pavel Grudinin, as Pamfilova reported, according to the processing of more than 99 percent of the ballots, he received 11.8 percent of the votes.\n\nThe Kremlin may have encouraged some candidates to run in the elections to make them appear competitive. Surrounded by weak rivals, Putin, who has been in power since 1999 when he succeeded Boris Yeltsin, was initially guaranteed victory in the election, which coincided with the fourth anniversary of Russia's annexation of Crimea.\n\nPutin's only real rival, blogger and activist Alexei Navalny, was barred from running due to a criminal record that he believes was staged to prevent him from running as a candidate. Navalny and his supporters said on Sunday that across Russia, voters were being bused to polling stations.\n\nDeputy head of the Central Election Commission Nikolai Bulaev rejected claims of violations, saying: \u201cNo country in the world is as open as we are. With such a degree of openness, every slightest violation is visible.\u201d\n\nHowever, videos posted by activists online show gross violations. At one polling station in the Republic of Sakha, a member of the election commission throws ballots into a box while voters wait in line to vote. An observer was beaten in Dagestan when he refused to stop filming an illegal vote. Another video shows a young woman stuffing ballots while observers are distracted.\n\nWhile Russian citizens were voting, the main question was: what will the turnout be?\n\nKremlin officials were clearly focused on achieving huge results for Putin to demonstrate his legitimacy, and by mid-afternoon, hours before polls closed, election officials were projecting turnout to be as high as 70 percent.\n\nKremlin insiders said before voting day that the desired outcome would be a \u201c70-70\u201d result: 70 percent of the vote for Putin with a 70 percent turnout.\n\nOn Sunday evening, the Central Election Commission announced that more than half of Russia's adult population had already voted, and turnout exceeded that of the previous elections, which took place in 2012.\n\nSome analysts believe the March 4 nerve agent poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal, which British authorities blame on Russia, was planned to provoke a confrontation with the West to boost turnout and support for Putin on a patriotic wave.\n\nThis suggestion was categorically rejected on the eve of the election by Putin's aides, who said Russia was not involved in the poisoning. Some officials claim that the incident was staged by British authorities.\n\nThe deterioration of British-Russian relations has given some voters pause.

This was especially noticeable in his message to the Federal Assembly, in which he stated that the world was now forced to listen to Russia.\n","uid":"00_08_77","input":"Some voters admitted that they voted for the incumbent president due to the lack of a real alternative\n\nMOSCOW - Russians went to the polls on Sunday to take part in a presidential election whose outcome few doubted.\n\nEven preliminary results, released shortly after polling stations in the Kaliningrad region closed, showed that incumbent head of state Vladimir Putin had secured victory in an election that critics say was staged.\n\nAccording to the latest data from the Russian Central Election Commission, published this morning in Moscow, Putin received more than 76 percent of the vote - a record result for his entire reign, as announced by Ella Pamfilova, chairman of the Russian Central Election Commission. It is unclear whether the Kremlin succeeded in achieving its goal of raising turnout to 70 percent - according to the latest data from the Russian Central Election Commission, it was 67.7 percent of all Russian voters. However, these data are not yet final, and Kremlin officials insisted that this figure would be achieved after all the calculations.\n\nDuring the voting, there were reports of hundreds of irregularities with ballot papers at polling stations in different parts of the country. Election officials played them down, saying only that the reports were being investigated.\n\nPutin's closest rival, candidate from the Communist Party of the Russian Federation Pavel Grudinin, as Pamfilova reported, according to the processing of more than 99 percent of the ballots, he received 11.8 percent of the votes.\n\nThe Kremlin may have encouraged some candidates to run in the elections to make them appear competitive. Surrounded by weak rivals, Putin, who has been in power since 1999 when he succeeded Boris Yeltsin, was initially guaranteed victory in the election, which coincided with the fourth anniversary of Russia's annexation of Crimea.\n\nPutin's only real rival, blogger and activist Alexei Navalny, was barred from running due to a criminal record that he believes was staged to prevent him from running as a candidate. Navalny and his supporters said on Sunday that across Russia, voters were being bused to polling stations.\n\nDeputy head of the Central Election Commission Nikolai Bulaev rejected claims of violations, saying: \u201cNo country in the world is as open as we are. With such a degree of openness, every slightest violation is visible.\u201d\n\nHowever, videos posted by activists online show gross violations. At one polling station in the Republic of Sakha, a member of the election commission throws ballots into a box while voters wait in line to vote. An observer was beaten in Dagestan when he refused to stop filming an illegal vote. Another video shows a young woman stuffing ballots while observers are distracted.\n\nWhile Russian citizens were voting, the main question was: what will the turnout be?\n\nKremlin officials were clearly focused on achieving huge results for Putin to demonstrate his legitimacy, and by mid-afternoon, hours before polls closed, election officials were projecting turnout to be as high as 70 percent.\n\nKremlin insiders said before voting day that the desired outcome would be a \u201c70-70\u201d result: 70 percent of the vote for Putin with a 70 percent turnout.\n\nOn Sunday evening, the Central Election Commission announced that more than half of Russia's adult population had already voted, and turnout exceeded that of the previous elections, which took place in 2012.\n\nSome analysts believe the March 4 nerve agent poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal, which British authorities blame on Russia, was planned to provoke a confrontation with the West to boost turnout and support for Putin on a patriotic wave.\n\nThis suggestion was categorically rejected on the eve of the election by Putin's aides, who said Russia was not involved in the poisoning. Some officials claim that the incident was staged by British authorities.\n\nThe deterioration of British-Russian relations has given some voters pause. At a polling station in Moscow school No. 1250, businessman Alexey said: \u201cI think all these allegations were concocted by the British government. I don't think anyone poisoned Skripal. Our country did not poison anyone.\u201d\n\nPolice officers roamed across the street from the school, ready to respond to protests that had been talked about but never materialized.\n\nMost Muscovites interviewed by the Voice of America correspondent said that Putin is the ideal candidate. Some voters explained that they support him because he has restored Russia's power and transformed the country from a regional power to a global one.\n\nBefore the vote, Putin emphasized the restoration of Russian power. This was especially noticeable in his message to the Federal Assembly, in which he stated that the world was now forced to listen to Russia.\n"}

Instead, he tried to turn the tables on the West, charging that the four criminal cases against former President Donald Trump were a use of the judiciary for political aims.\n\"The whole world is laughing at it,\" he said.\nSome people told the AP that they were happy to vote for Putin \u2014 unsurprising in a country where state TV airs a drumbeat of praise for the Russian leader and voicing any other opinion is risky.\nDmitry Sergienko, who cast his ballot in Moscow, said, \"I am happy with everything and want everything to continue as it is now.\"\nVoting took place over three days at polling stations across the vast country, in illegally annexed regions of Ukraine and online.\nSeveral people were arrested, including in Moscow and St. Petersburg, after they tried to start fires or set off explosives at polling stations while a few others were detained for throwing green antiseptic or ink into ballot boxes. Many more were rounded up by police for attempting to protest.\nThe OVD-Info group that monitors political arrests said that about 90 people were arrested in 22 cities across Russia on Sunday.\nStanislav Andreychuk, co-chair of the Golos independent election watchdog, said Russians were searched when entering polling stations, there were attempts to check filled-out ballots before they were cast, and one report said police demanded a ballot box be opened to remove a ballot.\nHuge lines formed around noon outside diplomatic missions in London, Berlin, Paris and other cities with large Russian communities, many of whom left home after Putin's invasion of Ukraine."}

Putin won 87.32% of the support in the 2024 presidential election. Putin has actually won the election.\nKharitonov, the candidate nominated by the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, received 4.32% of the votes, Davankov, the candidate nominated by the Russian New People's Party, received 3.79% of the votes, and Slutsky, the candidate nominated by the Russian Liberal Democratic Party, received 3.19% of the votes.\nPutin came to the campaign headquarters near the Kremlin to deliver a speech in the early morning of the 18th, and then held a press conference.\nPutin said that the source of Russian power is the people, and the votes of every Russian citizen constitute the unified will of the people. He will continue to promote national development in his new term.\nPutin pointed out that all the main tasks and goals of Russia's development have been elaborated in the recent State of the Union address to both houses of parliament, and he will do his best to achieve the set goals. Russia will move forward and become stronger, more powerful and more efficient.\nRegarding the Ukrainian issue, Putin stated that the initiative on the frontline of the special military operation against Ukraine lies entirely in the hands of the Russian army. The issue of special military operations and strengthening Russia's defense capabilities are one of the main tasks of his new term. He said that Russia supports peace negotiations, but not just because the other side is running out of bullets, but if they truly, seriously and long-term hope that the two countries can establish peace, Russia supports negotiations on the Ukrainian issue. \"This is a very serious issue.\"\nPutin also said that considering the Ukrainian army's attacks on Russia's Belgorod region and other places, Russia does not rule out the possibility of establishing a \"safe zone\" in the border area at some point.\nRegarding the United States, Putin once again stated that Russia has no preference for any American presidential candidate and that Russia is ready to cooperate with any American leader that American voters vote for.\nWhen answering the question of whether a full-scale conflict between Russia and NATO is possible and how likely it is, Putin said, \"Everything is possible in the modern world.\" He pointed out that there are currently military personnel from NATO countries in Ukraine, and they are \"dying in large numbers.\"\nRegarding Sino-Russian relations, Putin said that after years of development, Russia-China relations are very stable and highly complementary. Putin pointed out that Russia and China have many points of convergence in economic, diplomatic and other fields. As far as the development of the Eurasian region is concerned, Russia-China relations are an important stabilizing factor, and the joint construction of the \"Belt and Road\" initiative proposed by China is very important.\nPutin spoke positively of China's development achievements. He believes that China is achieving rapid development with great confidence and transforming into an innovative economy; China is increasingly active on the international stage and has achieved great success, and has many friends around the world.\nPutin emphasized that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China; those who seek provocation around Taiwan and take various measures to delay China's development will undoubtedly fail completely.\nOfficial voting for Russia\u2019s eighth presidential election will be held from the 15th to the 17th.

Western countries and election watchdogs have been quick to call it a \u201csham\u201d contest.\nPutin\u2019s comments come after French President Emmanuel Macron said last week he could not rule out the deployment of French troops in Ukraine if Russia\u2019s invasion continues. \nPutin also raised the prospect of taking Ukraine\u2019s Kharkiv region as a buffer zone between the two countries. Ukraine had reportedly increased its shelling on Russian border regions during the vote. \nWith no viable alternative candidates permitted to participate in the three-day election, Putin claimed 87% of the vote, according to exit polling published by the state-run Russian Public Opinion Research Center and the Public Opinion Foundation. That figure is an increase from 2018, when Putin claimed 76.7% of the vote with a voter turnout of 67.5%. The latest result extends Putin\u2019s nearly 25-year rule with a fifth term that will last until 2030. \nThe White House said the election was \u201cobviously not free nor fair,\u201d while Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky, said Sunday that Putin had become \u201caddicted to power.\u201d  \nDuring his Monday address, Putin also acknowledged Alexei Navalny for the first time since the opposition leader\u2019s death in a Russian penal colony on Feb. 16.

Western countries and election watchdogs have been quick to call it a \u201csham\u201d contest.\nPutin\u2019s comments come after French President Emmanuel Macron said last week he could not rule out the deployment of French troops in Ukraine if Russia\u2019s invasion continues. \nPutin also raised the prospect of taking Ukraine\u2019s Kharkiv region as a buffer zone between the two countries. Ukraine had reportedly increased its shelling on Russian border regions during the vote. \nWith no viable alternative candidates permitted to participate in the three-day election, Putin claimed 87% of the vote, according to exit polling published by the state-run Russian Public Opinion Research Center and the Public Opinion Foundation. That figure is an increase from 2018, when Putin claimed 76.7% of the vote with a voter turnout of 67.5%. The latest result extends Putin\u2019s nearly 25-year rule with a fifth term that will last until 2030. \nThe White House said the election was \u201cobviously not free nor fair,\u201d while Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky, said Sunday that Putin had become \u201caddicted to power.\u201d  \nDuring his Monday address, Putin also acknowledged Alexei Navalny for the first time since the opposition leader\u2019s death in a Russian penal colony on Feb. 16.

There is Leonid Slutsky \u2013 heir to the late firebrand, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, of the far-right Liberal Democratic Party (LDPR); Nikolai Kharitonov of the Communist Party, and Vladislav Davankov of the New People party, and deputy chairman of the State Duma (the Russian parliament).\nThis has been a standard lineup in Russian presidential elections for years.

Boris Nadezhdin had been hoping to stand as the anti-war candidate, and had enjoyed some campaigning success. Perhaps too much, because he was barred in time-honoured fashion, after too many of his endorsing signatures were ruled invalid.\nThe prominent opposition figure, and anti-corruption campaigner, Alexei Navalny, had also been excluded by dint of a string of prison sentences. Indeed, he had been kept out of all elections since a better-than-forecast 27 per cent in the Moscow mayoral election of 2013. His sudden death in the Polar Wolf prison camp last month, however, may not mark the end of the Navalny effect on Russian politics.\nAs for those who will be on the ballot paper, the latest Russian polls forecast as follows: Putin \u2013 75 per cent; Slutsky \u2013 3 per cent; Kharitonov \u2013 4 per cent, and Davankov \u2013 6 per cent. What is more, the awkward truth is that those figures do not have to have been manipulated. Unpopular though the war may be in some quarters, Putin\u2019s support has held up (along with living standards and national morale), and all despite the strange mutiny by Yevgeny Prigozhin and the Wagner mercenaries last June.\n","translation":"","uid":"00_00_36","input":"\nRussian voters\u2019 choice of candidates is also as circumscribed as it mostly was.

Perhaps too much, because he was barred in time-honoured fashion, after too many of his endorsing signatures were ruled invalid.\nThe prominent opposition figure, and anti-corruption campaigner, Alexei Navalny, had also been excluded by dint of a string of prison sentences. Indeed, he had been kept out of all elections since a better-than-forecast 27 per cent in the Moscow mayoral election of 2013. His sudden death in the Polar Wolf prison camp last month, however, may not mark the end of the Navalny effect on Russian politics.\nAs for those who will be on the ballot paper, the latest Russian polls forecast as follows: Putin \u2013 75 per cent; Slutsky \u2013 3 per cent; Kharitonov \u2013 4 per cent, and Davankov \u2013 6 per cent. What is more, the awkward truth is that those figures do not have to have been manipulated. Unpopular though the war may be in some quarters, Putin\u2019s support has held up (along with living standards and national morale), and all despite the strange mutiny by Yevgeny Prigozhin and the Wagner mercenaries last June.\n"}

Putin got 52.9 percent of votes in 2000, 71.3 percent in 2004 and 63.6 percent in 2012.\n\nAccording to the CEC, Communist Party candidate Pavel Grudinin, Putin's nearest rival, got 11.9 percent of votes, while the head of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, received 5.66 percent. Five other candidates gained substantially less support.\n\nSome 73.4 million Russians, or 67.5 percent of the whole population, cast their ballots, and possible loopholes had been avoided by lawmakers to ensure transparency and openness of the presidential campaigns, said Valentina Matvienko, Russian parliament's upper house speaker.\n\nAbout 275,000 law enforcement officers were deployed to ensure law and order at the polling stations, the Interior Ministry said in a statement, adding that there were no violations that could affect the course or results of the election.\n\nPutin, 65, first became Russian president in 2000, re-elected in 2004, and became president for the third time in 2012 after serving as prime minister for four years. He announced seeking a fourth term in late 2017 under the campaign slogan of \"Strong President, Strong Russia.\"\n\nAt a rally outside the Red Square in Moscow on Sunday night, Putin thanked his supporters across the country and stressed the importance of preserving national unity.\n\nAt his campaign headquarters, Putin chanted \"Russia! Russia! Russia!\" with the personnel there, saying that \"We will think about the future of our great motherland and the future of our children.\"\n\nHe called on all Russian political forces to work together on the \"very complicated\" state tasks guided by national interests, urging extraordinary efforts to make new breakthroughs.\n\nThe president said he plans to reshuffle the government after his inauguration on May 7 and will consider prime minister and other government members from now on. When asked if people will see a new Putin in the next six years, he said \"We are all changing.\"\n\nWhen asked about Russia's relationship with China, Putin said China is Russia's strategic partner and bilateral relations are at an \"unprecedentedly high\" level, which Russia values very much.\n\nHe said his country will make every effort to expand cooperation with China, including the connection between the Belt and Road Initiative and the Eurasian Economic Union.\n\nThe Belt and Road Initiative -- the initiative on the construction of the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road -- aims to build trade and infrastructure networks connecting Asia with Europe and Africa along the ancient Silk Road routes. It comprises the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road.\n\nAs for relations with the European countries, Putin said Russia is ready to work with them to settle any disputes, citing the allegations that Russia was involved in the chemical attack against ex-spy Sergei Skripal in Britain as \"complete nonsense.\"\n\nSince Putin was elected president for the first time in 2000, Russia has recovered from the collapse of the former Soviet Union and cemented its status as a big power.\n\nWith actions such as anti-terrorist operations in Syria, Putin has built up his prestige among Russians and gained additional influence in the global arena.\n\nHe has created a political system necessary to respond to any challenges, said Alexei Mukhin, director general of the Center for Political Information, a Moscow-based think tank.","translation":"","uid":"00_06_32","input":"Incumbent Russian President Vladimir Putin was elected president for the fourth time in a landslide victory on Sunday, gaining \"unprecedented\" public support throughout his campaigns.\n\nPutin won more than 76.6 percent of ballots after 99.83 percent of votes have been counted in Sunday's presidential election, the Central Election Commission (CEC) Chair Ella Pamfilova said, citing preliminary data.\n\nIn accordance with the law, a candidate garnering more than half of the votes goes to the Kremlin.

current term as President of Russia will end on May 7, 2024. According to the Russian constitution, Putin can seek re-election for two terms until 2036 after this term ends.\nAt the Heroes of the Motherland Day award ceremony in December 2023, Putin announced that he would participate in the 2024 presidential election. At that time, Artem Zoga, chairman of the People's Committee of the \"Donetsk People's Republic\", talked with Putin after the ceremony and said that the entire Donbas region hopes that Putin will participate in the election. Putin responded: \"I had different ideas at different times, but now the moment has come when I have to make a decision. I will run for president of Russia.\"\nIn this Russian election, Putin is the only presidential candidate running as an independent candidate. Some analysts believe that Putin has run as an independent candidate in three of his four elections. This approach will help him shape his image as a representative of all Russia, rather than just representing a certain party.\nAs in previous elections, Putin will not participate in pre-election debates on television and radio programs. Russian Presidential Press Secretary Peskov said that Putin is the current head of state and has a very busy schedule, which makes him fundamentally different from other candidates. The president himself appears in the media every day, and Russians have a daily opportunity to see what Putin has to say about all aspects of life.\nAlthough he did not participate in the pre-election debates, Putin frequently appeared in various domestic activities before the Russian election. After announcing his candidacy, at the end of 2023, Putin held his first \"live connection\" event and annual press conference since the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. In more than 4 hours, he answered about 80 questions from the Russian people and domestic and foreign reporters. The content covered is very wide. At the event, Putin pointed out that the Russian economy had recovered from the downward trend, emphasized that the goals of Russia's \"special military operations\" had not changed, and also mentioned the need for Russia to return to traditional values.\nAfter entering 2024, Putin\u2019s domestic itinerary is relatively intensive. From the Chukotka Autonomous Region in Russia\u2019s Far East, which he has never visited before, to the enclave of Kaliningrad in western Russia, Putin talked about the regional economy during his visits to many places. Development, social security and other livelihood issues, and visited a number of industrial enterprises including Ural Vagon Zavod (one of the largest military equipment developers and manufacturers in Russia) and Kazan Aviation Plant to understand the business operations of the enterprises.\nIn early February, Putin accepted an exclusive interview with American journalist Tucker Carlson. This was Putin's first one-on-one interview with Western media since the Russia-Ukraine conflict broke out in February 2022. In an interview, he emphasized that Russia would not expand the Russia-Ukraine conflict to other parts of Europe, and said that only if the United States stops providing weapons to Ukraine can a peaceful solution to the conflict be possible.\nIn his two-hour State of the Union address on February 29, which set a new record in length, Putin focused on people's livelihood issues and repeatedly emphasized that Russia should solve population problems, promote economic development, and achieve technological independence.","uid":"03_07_23","input":"Putin's current term as President of Russia will end on May 7, 2024.

After the missile threat was lifted, people returned and continued voting."}

The Kremlin denied it had any involvement in the 47-year-old's death, with Russian authorities saying it was due to \"natural causes.\"\nAddressing his supporters and the press at his campaign headquarters last night, Putin was relaxed and upbeat, pledging to defend and strengthen Russia. He also used the moment to make his first public comments on Navalny's death, and mentioning his most vocal critic's name for the first time in public in years.\nWhen asked by NBC's Keir Simmons about the death, Putin responded by calling his death a \"sad event\" and claiming he had been prepared to involve Navalny in a prisoner swap with the West.\n\"As for Mr. Navalny. He has perished, this is always a sad event. Well, we have had other instances when people died in prison. Has nothing like that ever happened in the U.S.? It has happened, and not once,\" Putin told the assembled press and supporters Sunday night, in comments translated by NBC.\n\"By the way, this will be unexpected but several days before Mr Navalny perished, I was told by some of my colleagues and the administration employees, some people, that there is an idea to exchange Mr Navalny for some people in prison in Western countries. Believe me or not, the person talking to me hardly finished their sentence when I said: 'I agree!' he claimed.\nPutin said he had agreed to the proposal on the condition that Navalny should never return to Russia, where he was the figurehead of Russia's opposition movement.\n\"But unfortunately, the thing that happened happened,\" Putin said, adding, \"Such things happen, you can't do anything about it.

The Kremlin denied it had any involvement in the 47-year-old's death, with Russian authorities saying it was due to \"natural causes.\"\nAddressing his supporters and the press at his campaign headquarters last night, Putin was relaxed and upbeat, pledging to defend and strengthen Russia. He also used the moment to make his first public comments on Navalny's death, and mentioning his most vocal critic's name for the first time in public in years.\nWhen asked by NBC's Keir Simmons about the death, Putin responded by calling his death a \"sad event\" and claiming he had been prepared to involve Navalny in a prisoner swap with the West.\n\"As for Mr. Navalny. He has perished, this is always a sad event. Well, we have had other instances when people died in prison. Has nothing like that ever happened in the U.S.?

But he was also displaying imperial ambitions, fighting wars in Chechnya and Georgia.\nAfter Medvedev pushed through a constitutional change allowing additional presidential terms, Putin regained the presidency in 2012.

But he was also displaying imperial ambitions, fighting wars in Chechnya and Georgia.\nAfter Medvedev pushed through a constitutional change allowing additional presidential terms, Putin regained the presidency in 2012. Amid the most fervent protests against the autocratic and corrupt regime, his government began instituting and escalating brutal crackdowns on minority groups like the LGBTQ population, opposition members, and civil society to entrench a narrative of Russian tradition. \n\u201cIn the 1990s\u20132000s, Russia experienced a range of issues such as economic and demographic crises and the loss of its impactful role on the international stage, causing the perceived \u2018emasculation\u2019 of the population,\u201d Radzhana Buyantueva, a researcher studying LGBTQ communities in Russia and their intersection with the political sphere, explained to Vox over email in December. \u201cThe Kremlin has utilized these insecurities in its anti-gender queerphobic propaganda,\u201d cracking down on LGBTQ groups and other perceived opponents while also militarizing society and \u201cculminating in the escalating military aggression toward neighboring states (Georgia in 2008 and Ukraine since 2014).\u201d\nPutin also systematically undermined or eliminated political opposition, cementing his hold on power not just through a popular narrative about Russia\u2019s national identity, but also with election fraud, murder, poisonings, draconian jail sentences, and other political repression. \nOver the past year, the Kremlin quashed multiple attempts to compete against him in this weekend\u2019s elections. Though three competitors did stand in this year\u2019s contest, they were all state-backed and lacked any real popular support. There were multiple true opposition candidates with demonstrated popular support \u2014 like Boris Nadezhdin, an anti-war candidate \u2014 who attempted to stand against Putin this year but were barred from doing so.  \nNow, almost anyone who would vocally oppose or present an alternative to Russian propaganda has been silenced or has fled."}

\u201csuper majority.\u201d This was stated by VTsIOM General Director Valery Fedorov at a round table held on March 18 at the Rossiya Segodnya media center.\n\nThe expert noted that before the elections, VTsIOM predicted that the turnout would be 71%, and 82% of voters would vote for Putin. In reality, the president received 87.28% of the votes with a turnout of 74.22%.\n\n\u201cThese are interconnected things. It was the historically high turnout that influenced the election result,\u201d Fedorov emphasized.\n\nThe head of VTsIOM added that several factors influenced Putin\u2019s record result. This, in particular, is the \u201cDonbass consensus\u201d in society and a broad demand for the greatness and pride of the country, for stability and protection - all this the voter associates with the figure of the president. In addition, according to the majority, it is Putin who is suitable for the role of national leader at the current time.\n\nThe head of the Center for Political Current Affairs, Alexey Chesnakov, noted that during the elections, ideological and value factors were of great importance, which shaped the voter\u2019s opinion. \u201cPutin gives answers to their requests,\u201d he emphasized.\n\nThe expert noted that the \u201cconsolidation around the flag\u201d that began two years ago has not disappeared anywhere. \u201cPeople don\u2019t see an alternative to Putin\u2019s course. The voter was absolutely focused on winning the SVO,\u201d says Chesnakov.\n\nPolitical scientist Alexander Asafov highlighted a historically high turnout of 66% in Moscow, where more than 60% of voters have never come to the polling stations in presidential elections. He connects this not only with people\u2019s emotions, but also with the opportunity to vote electronically in the capital. \u201cMoscow residents live in a digital environment. For them, this is an organic tool,\u201d the specialist noted.\n\nPresident of the communications holding Minchenko Consulting Evgeniy Minchenko assessed the election results for parliamentary parties. In his opinion, the party \u201cA Just Russia - For Truth\u201d lost the most by not putting forward its candidate - this could negatively affect the prospects of the political force. The expert believes that the greatest benefit was received by the \u201cNew People\u201d - their candidate Vladislav Davankov with 3.85% of the votes.\n\nThe prospects of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation (candidate Nikolai Kharitonov - 4.31%) and the Liberal Democratic Party (Leonid Slutsky - 3.20%) are doubtful - the leaders of these associations were clearly counting on more.\n\nFinally, political scientist Pavel Danilin recalled that the current campaign took place under unprecedented pressure from the outside. Western countries and Ukraine tried in every possible way to disrupt the presidential elections, including shelling polling stations.\n\n\u201cBut they received a harsh response. Despite intimidation, missile and UAV attacks, people went to the polls. Thus, they said \u201cno\u201d to pressure and provocations. The people of Russia responded with unprecedented readiness for unification,\u201d Danilin said.","uid":"00_08_76","input":"The situation that has developed in Russia after Vladimir Putin\u2019s victory in the 2024 presidential elections can be described as a \u201csuper majority.\u201d This was stated by VTsIOM General Director Valery Fedorov at a round table held on March 18 at the Rossiya Segodnya media center.\n\nThe expert noted that before the elections, VTsIOM predicted that the turnout would be 71%, and 82% of voters would vote for Putin.

Many African countries have also expressed support for Putin's election.\nChinese President Xi Jinping called Putin to express his congratulations, saying \"this result fully reflects the support of the Russian people for you.\" Xi Jinping also said that Beijing will \"maintain close communication with Moscow and promote the sustained, healthy, stable and in-depth development of the China-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination for a new era.\"\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered \"warm congratulations\" to Putin, adding that he looked forward to developing their \"special\" relationship.\nRussia is India's largest arms supplier, and India, China and Russia are all members of the BRICS emerging economies, aiming to challenge the United States' dominance of the global economy.\nAccording to North Korea\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said that Russian voters have shown \u201cunwavering support and trust\u201d in Putin and said that he would create a \u201cnew turning point in the friendship between North Korea and Russia.\u201d\nSome analysts pointed out that these contrasting reactions highlighted the geopolitical rifts that have widened since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine two years ago, triggering the deepest crisis in Russia's relations with the West since the end of the Cold War.","uid":"03_00_31","input":"Russian President Vladimir Putin was elected president for the fifth time with 87.28% of the vote and is preparing to start a new fifth six-year term.

Many African countries have also expressed support for Putin's election.\nChinese President Xi Jinping called Putin to express his congratulations, saying \"this result fully reflects the support of the Russian people for you.\" Xi Jinping also said that Beijing will \"maintain close communication with Moscow and promote the sustained, healthy, stable and in-depth development of the China-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination for a new era.\"\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered \"warm congratulations\" to Putin, adding that he looked forward to developing their \"special\" relationship.\nRussia is India's largest arms supplier, and India, China and Russia are all members of the BRICS emerging economies, aiming to challenge the United States' dominance of the global economy.\nAccording to North Korea\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said that Russian voters have shown \u201cunwavering support and trust\u201d in Putin and said that he would create a \u201cnew turning point in the friendship between North Korea and Russia.\u201d\nSome analysts pointed out that these contrasting reactions highlighted the geopolitical rifts that have widened since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine two years ago, triggering the deepest crisis in Russia's relations with the West since the end of the Cold War."}

She was charged with \u201cdiscrediting the Russian army\u201d and fined 30,000 rubles ($342).\nRussian lawmakers have suggested introducing a new law to punish election saboteurs with sentences of up to eight years in prison."}

This would not be surprising as Putin had presided over major personnel changes in the past aiming to improve the efficiency of the bureaucratic apparatus,\" Tursa noted.\nAndrey Pertsev, a Russian journalist writing for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, noted in analysis last week that \"creating a new political post to oversee major social spending plans will cause a shift in the balance of power within Russia's bureaucracy.\"\n\"The social spending commitments made by Russian President Vladimir Putin in his February state of the nation\u00a0address\u00a0indicate that at least one Russian official will get an influential new job. The lucky person will likely be either a deputy prime minister with expanded powers, or a special coordinator\" that has direct and regular access to the president, he noted.\n\"Either way, they'll get regular access to the president, the opportunity to disburse large sums, and the tools to shape their public image. That will automatically create an alternative center of power within the government,\" he said.\nPertsev said the appointment is likely to prompt Russia's elite to start \"thinking about a possible successor to Putin.\"\n\"The person who gets the job will inevitably be seen in a new light ... For many years now, Putin has avoided a major reshuffle among Russia's top officials in order to head off any speculation about power transitions or successors. Now, however, he has little choice but to empower a major new political player,\" he said."}

weekdays, the specific matter Yuri is responsible for is industrial automation, focusing on the research of human-computer interaction technology. In Russia, where there is a strong demand for military equipment but a shortage of manpower, and there is an urgent need to improve corporate production efficiency, technical talents like Yuri are obviously very \"sought-after.\" Just recently, another steel plant invited him to join a new team with a higher salary than Yuri's current salary.\nYuri said he is still considering whether to accept the new company's offer. \"Although the salary is not much higher, employees are allowed to work remotely from home. This is a good choice because the recent attacks on military factories in Ukraine have made me increasingly worried about my safety.\"\nYuri's worries were not groundless. After the conflict between Russia and Ukraine broke out, in addition to fighting on the front line, the two sides also used drones, missiles, etc. to attack each other's military industrial facilities. In recent months, Ukraine has launched increasingly frequent drone attacks against Russian military and industrial targets. On the second anniversary of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, a steel plant owned by the Novolipetsk Metallurgical Company, which accounts for about 18% of Russia's steel output, was attacked by Ukrainian drones at night, and a fire broke out in the plant.\nYuri said that steel plants around the area where he lived had been targeted, but the attack was unsuccessful. Now, explosion-proof bunkers have been set up near the company where Yuri works. However, due to the rush, the construction period of the bunkers was very short, which also made Yuri skeptical about the effectiveness of these facilities.\nAlthough the war made Yuri's work closely related to the military industry, Yuri himself could not hide his anger and sadness when talking about the war. As chief engineer, Yuri's salary has never been low. But he admitted that many people around him are increasingly inclined to buy cheap and low-quality goods, including clothes, cars and other things. \"The war is costing money and it makes no sense. Prices are getting higher and higher.\"\nWhat makes Yuri even more sad is that he has some relatives and friends in Ukraine. But now it has become very difficult for him to communicate with these relatives and friends.\n\"Before the war started, Russians and Ukrainians on the border got along very well. Before, I didn't need a visa when I went to Ukraine, and our two peoples were deeply intertwined... Now, in many families, the strongest ties Already cut off. I can\u2019t find words to describe this nightmare day after day,\u201d Yuri said painfully.\nWhat worries Yuri the most are the children who chose to leave Russia under the war. Yuri\u2019s son-in-law once worked for the social platform Instagram, but Instagram was banned in Russia shortly after the conflict between Russia and Ukraine broke out. Because their work was affected and they were worried about being mobilized to the front line, Yuri's daughter and her family chose to leave their homeland. Yuri's son and nephew faced a similar dilemma. Currently, they all live in Armenia.\nAlthough Yuri's children have now found new jobs and started a new life in Armenia, he still looks forward to family reunion. \"We don't want to raise our future grandchildren in this atmosphere, but we still hope that the children will come back after the war is over. After all, we are older and moving to Armenia will not be easy.\"","uid":"03_07_75","input":"On weekdays, the specific matter Yuri is responsible for is industrial automation, focusing on the research of human-computer interaction technology. In Russia, where there is a strong demand for military equipment but a shortage of manpower, and there is an urgent need to improve corporate production efficiency, technical talents like Yuri are obviously very \"sought-after.\" Just recently, another steel plant invited him to join a new team with a higher salary than Yuri's current salary.\nYuri said he is still considering whether to accept the new company's offer. \"Although the salary is not much higher, employees are allowed to work remotely from home. This is a good choice because the recent attacks on military factories in Ukraine have made me increasingly worried about my safety.\"\nYuri's worries were not groundless. After the conflict between Russia and Ukraine broke out, in addition to fighting on the front line, the two sides also used drones, missiles, etc. to attack each other's military industrial facilities.

Current Russian President Vladimir Putin won the election. Pamfilova said that the final turnout rate for the 2024 Russian presidential election was 77.49%, and Putin's final vote rate was 87.28%, with 76,277,708 votes. (Kharitonov 4.31%, Davankov 3.85%, Slutsky 3.2%) According to the Russian constitution, Putin will be in power until 2030. If he wins the election again, he can be re-elected until 2036.\nPreliminary data after the vote showed that among the top ten regions with the highest support for Putin, his vote rates exceeded 90%. Crimea and the three \"new regions\" of Donetsk, Luhansk and Zaporozhye have also entered the top ten list of regions with Putin's approval rating.

In Ukraine\u2019s southern city of Mariupol, the city council posted on Telegram accusing authorities of working with construction companies to bus in teams of \u201cRussian builders\u201d to vote in the precinct, inflating turnout in the area.\nNumerous reports from parts of occupied Ukraine, such as  Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, included accusations from locals that members of the Russian military went door to door and forced Ukrainian citizens to vote at gunpoint.\nPhotos uploaded to Telegram by Mariupol\u2019s city council on Saturday claimed to show small-scale acts of protest by Ukrainians coerced into voting, including spoiling ballots.\nOnly one of the three candidates who oppose Putin in the election, Vladislav Davankov, supports peace negotiations with Ukraine.\nDavankov, a former businessman, has called for a peace deal with Ukraine that is \u201con our terms and with no rollback,\u201d while saying that Russia should not cede to Ukraine any territory it has already occupied.\nMore than 114 million Russians are eligible to vote in the election, including nearly 2 million abroad. Results are expected to be announced on Sunday, with a landslide for Putin functionally guaranteed."}

What is the significance of this wartime election? What signal does Putin hope to send to the outside world?\nAndrei Kortunov: The recently held presidential elections once again proved the overall stability of the Russian political system. The turnout exceeded 77%, and Putin received an unprecedented high support rate (87.28%, compared with 76.69% in the 2018 election). Clearly, these results suggest that fears \u2014 or hopes \u2014 about possible \u201cregime change\u201d in Russia are unfounded.

What is the significance of this wartime election? What signal does Putin hope to send to the outside world?\nAndrei Kortunov: The recently held presidential elections once again proved the overall stability of the Russian political system. The turnout exceeded 77%, and Putin received an unprecedented high support rate (87.28%, compared with 76.69% in the 2018 election).

News Agency, Moscow, March 18 (Reporter Chen Ting, Liu Kai, An Xiaomeng) According to data released by the Russian Central Election Commission in the early morning of the 18th local time, among the 85% of votes counted in the Russian presidential election, current President Putin won 87.19% of the votes. He is significantly ahead of other candidates and has actually won the presidential election.\nAnalysts believe that after Putin's re-election, Russia's domestic and foreign affairs will continue its existing policies, including focusing on strengthening technological independence, promoting economic diversification, actively developing relations with friendly countries in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America, and promoting the development of a multi-polar world. .\n\nwin\nThe official voting for Russia's eighth presidential election was held from the 15th to the 17th. A total of four candidates participated in the election, including the current Russian President Vladimir Putin, Russia's Liberal Democratic Party's Slutsky, the Russian Federation's Communist Party's Kharitonov and the Russian newcomer Davankov of the party.\nAccording to data from the Russian Central Election Commission, among the 85% of votes counted in the Russian presidential election, Putin, Kharitonov, Davankov, and Slutsky received 87.19%, 4.24%, 3.99%, and 3.16% of the votes respectively. .\nAccording to the Russian presidential election rules, the person who gets more than 50% of the votes in the election is elected president, so Putin has actually won the election. The Russian Central Election Commission will confirm the results of the presidential election no later than March 28 and announce them within three days after the election results are confirmed.\nIn the early morning of the 18th, Putin delivered a speech at the campaign headquarters and thanked all voters for their support. He said that Russia will move forward further and become more solid, stronger and more efficient.\n\nTechnological independence and economic diversification\nAfter the Russian economy suffered shocks in the early stages of the escalation of the Ukraine crisis, it has gradually shown resilience. Data released by the Russian Federal State Statistics Service in early February this year show that Russia\u2019s GDP will grow by 3.6% in 2023. However, Western countries' blockade of Russia in the fields of finance, investment, and technological product imports has brought difficulties to the long-term development of the Russian economy.

He is significantly ahead of other candidates and has actually won the presidential election.\nAnalysts believe that after Putin's re-election, Russia's domestic and foreign affairs will continue its existing policies, including focusing on strengthening technological independence, promoting economic diversification, actively developing relations with friendly countries in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America, and promoting the development of a multi-polar world. .\n\nwin\nThe official voting for Russia's eighth presidential election was held from the 15th to the 17th. A total of four candidates participated in the election, including the current Russian President Vladimir Putin, Russia's Liberal Democratic Party's Slutsky, the Russian Federation's Communist Party's Kharitonov and the Russian newcomer Davankov of the party.\nAccording to data from the Russian Central Election Commission, among the 85% of votes counted in the Russian presidential election, Putin, Kharitonov, Davankov, and Slutsky received 87.19%, 4.24%, 3.99%, and 3.16% of the votes respectively. .\nAccording to the Russian presidential election rules, the person who gets more than 50% of the votes in the election is elected president, so Putin has actually won the election. The Russian Central Election Commission will confirm the results of the presidential election no later than March 28 and announce them within three days after the election results are confirmed.\nIn the early morning of the 18th, Putin delivered a speech at the campaign headquarters and thanked all voters for their support. He said that Russia will move forward further and become more solid, stronger and more efficient.\n\nTechnological independence and economic diversification\nAfter the Russian economy suffered shocks in the early stages of the escalation of the Ukraine crisis, it has gradually shown resilience. Data released by the Russian Federal State Statistics Service in early February this year show that Russia\u2019s GDP will grow by 3.6% in 2023. However, Western countries' blockade of Russia in the fields of finance, investment, and technological product imports has brought difficulties to the long-term development of the Russian economy. How to continue to hedge against the impact of Western sanctions is a task for Putin's administration.\nIn his State of the Union address delivered to both houses of parliament at the end of February, Putin stated that factors such as a lack of talent and insufficient own-owned advanced technology may lead to a slowdown in economic growth. Therefore, the country will vigorously strengthen the development of education, science and technology and other fields, and let technological independence become the driving force for industrial upgrading to improve the efficiency and competitiveness of the Russian economy.\nHe proposed that by 2030, the share of Russia's high-tech products and services in the domestic market should increase by 50%, and the export of non-raw materials and non-energy products should increase by at least two-thirds.

Russia is very aware of the situation, but the prospects for these soldiers are not good. \"We heard French and English there, and first of all it didn't do them any good because they were dying in large numbers,\" he said.\r\n\n\r\nWhen asked by a reporter whether a full-scale conflict between Russia and NATO was possible, Putin replied that he believed that \"everything is possible\" in today's world and that a world war is only one step away, but no one wants such a thing to happen. thing.\r\n\n\r\nPutin said Russia was ready to cooperate with any U.S. president American voters voted for. \"We have no preference for any one candidate for President of the United States and will work with the one whom voters give their vote of confidence.\"\r\n\n\n\n\n\nMany countries congratulate Putin on his victory\n\n\r\nAfter Putin sealed his victory in the election, many Russian politicians sent congratulations.\r\n\n\r\nVolodin, Chairman of the Russian State Duma, posted on the social media Telegram: \"I congratulate Putin on his convincing victory in the presidential election!

In Russia, the results of the election have been announced: Putin was successfully re-elected with an overwhelming 87% of the vote. This is also his fifth presidential term. Putin declared victory and began his fifth presidential term.\n\nSo why was Putin elected for the fifth time? This has something to do with Russia\u2019s electoral laws. As early as 2020, Putin revised the election law, stipulating that the current head of state can serve two consecutive terms as president, and each presidential term is extended to 6 years. This means that Putin may remain president until 2036, when he retires at the age of 84.\n\nRussia's election results showed that Putin won 87% of the votes, sealing victory in advance. This result also triggered a lot of discussion about Putin's re-election. What does Putin's victory mean? What impact does this have on China? Let\u2019s explore these topics.\n\nAt present, it seems that Putin is very likely to win the election, because his vote share has been increasing every year since he came to power. In 2000, it was only 52.9%, but this year it has reached 87.15%. This shows that Putin's prestige in Russia is unshakable.\n\nWhat does Putin's victory mean for Russia? First of all, this is very necessary for the current Russia. Because the current situation in Russia is not optimistic.\n\nThe outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict means that Russia is actually confronting the United States and the entire NATO countries. Although Ukraine sends troops, the weapons, ammunition, combat funds and maintenance behind them are all provided by NATO. NATO has signed an agreement to provide Ukraine with artillery shells worth $1.2 billion.\n\nCoupled with the sanctions imposed by Western countries led by the United States, Russia is currently in \"chaotic times.\" In this case, a leader with strong appeal is needed to lead the overall situation to maintain the stability of the country. Therefore, many countries will basically not change their leaders during a state of war.\n\nAt the same time, as NATO gradually intervenes, the military pressure faced by Russia will only increase, not decrease. In the economic field, Russia's sanctions are still escalating. After the conflict broke out two years ago, Russia's overseas assets were frozen by the European Union and the United States. However, as long as it is done properly, the funds can actually be recovered.\n\nFor Putin, re-election is very important to Russia's strategic stability. For China, Putin's re-election is actually a good thing. First of all, the United States has long openly listed China as a hostile country.

everyone expected, the current Russian President Vladimir Putin successfully won re-election, and various accusations from Western countries were also thrown away. Moscow quickly responded and named Merkel, who has served as German Chancellor for four consecutive times and has been at the helm of Germany for 16 years.\r\n\n\r\nAccording to a report by \"Russia Today\" on March 18, a spokesperson for the Russian Foreign Ministry said that a series of NATO actions against Russia will only help Putin win a fifth term. Zakharova said that by consolidating NATO's image as a \"dangerous enemy\" in the minds of Russians, the West precisely ensured Putin's historic victory in the presidential election.\r\n\n\r\nAccording to Russian media, the German Foreign Ministry said that the Russian presidential election was \"neither free nor fair\" and that \"the results were not surprising.\" The White House echoed this statement last Sunday. British Defense Secretary Shapps accused Putin of \"stealing the election again\" but \"cannot steal Ukraine.\"\u200b\r\n\n\r\nAccording to data released by the Russian Central Election Commission on the 18th, with all votes counted, current President Putin received 87.28% of the vote, overwhelmingly winning his fifth term. The \"Russia Today\" website also pointed out that the turnout rate in this year's election was as high as 74%, which not only exceeded the 67.47% in the 2018 election, but also set a record high.

This means that during his new term of office, Putin will also face various difficulties brought about by Western all-round economic sanctions, such as the adjustment of economic structure inside and outside Russia.\nIn his 2024 State of the Union address, Putin proposed many specific goals, such as increasing the share of the country's high-tech products and services in the domestic market, increasing non-resource and non-energy exports, reducing the proportion of imports, and achieving more technological independence.\n\u200b"}

There is no suspense about his victory. Putin will continue to rule the Russian government for the next six years. The 71-year-old Putin declared victory after confirming his fifth re-election. He said at the campaign headquarters: \"First of all, I want to thank the Russian people. We are one. Although there are many issues at hand, our unity is beyond doubt.

said at the forum that day that the global economic system is undergoing \"fundamental and irreversible\" changes, and Russia hopes to establish a world economic development model with truly fair competition for all participants. Published by Xinhua News Agency (Photo by Alexander)\n In the 1990s, when Russia became an independent country, the political situation was ups and downs and continued to be unstable. \"Shock therapy\" led to a severe economic recession, soaring prices, and poor people's livelihood. Putin once worriedly believed that Russia was in danger of becoming a second- or even third-rate country in the world.\n Since taking over the Kremlin in 2000, Putin has vigorously cracked down on the oligarchy and restored the country's control over the economic lifeline. At the same time, he actively adjusted economic policies, promoted structural reforms, and combated the shadow economy. At the beginning of the 21st century, Russia took advantage of the rising international oil prices to step out of its predicament and achieve rapid economic development. As its economic strength increases, Russia's international influence gradually increases.\n When the Ukraine crisis broke out in 2014, facing the threat of Western sanctions, Russia began to make long-term plans, implement an import substitution strategy, strive to get rid of its dependence on energy exports, strengthen financial security construction, and continue to promote economic de-dollarization. Russia withstood the comprehensive sanctions initiated by the West in early 2022 and began to achieve economic growth in the second half of 2022.\n Russian political scientist Oleg Matvechev said that it is under Putin's leadership that Russia has resolved one crisis after another.\n Moscow citizen Irina said she was proud of the country and President Putin. It was Putin who made Russia a country that would not be bullied at will. The West always attempts to use various means such as economic sanctions to isolate Russia, but their plots have not succeeded.\n Fighting Western Suppression\n Shortly before the start of voting in this Russian presidential election, Sweden became the 32nd member of NATO, completing a new round of expansion of NATO. At the same time, the United States and the West continue to \"add fuel to the fire\" to the Ukraine crisis, and the geopolitical game between Russia and the West is intensifying.\n\n On March 11, Swedish Prime Minister Kristersson (left) and NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg attended a joint press conference at the NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium.

Photo by Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhao Dingzhe\n Putin has stated on many occasions on different occasions that he will never sit idly by and ignore NATO's provocations, and emphasized his determination to safeguard the country's territorial sovereignty. His warning was straightforward, highlighting Russia's uncompromising bottom line on national security issues.\n When Putin delivered his State of the Union address this year, he said that the West had failed in its attempts to plunge Russia into strife and civil strife. Russia does not allow anyone to interfere in Russia's internal affairs, and any armed intervention will suffer an unprecedented defeat.\n Russian political scientist Sergei Markov said that people support Putin because Putin is a symbol of sovereignty and independence in the face of Western pressure on Russia. People realize that Putin has the ability to lead Russia to fight back against U.S. hegemony and safeguard national interests.\n Russian voter Vycheslav said that Russians regard Putin as a leader who fights against U.S. hegemony and are willing to work with Putin to oppose NATO's eastward expansion and defend national security.","uid":"03_00_11","input":"Putin said at the forum that day that the global economic system is undergoing \"fundamental and irreversible\" changes, and Russia hopes to establish a world economic development model with truly fair competition for all participants.

Welle Chinese website) According to China Central Television, on March 18, Chinese President Xi Jinping called Putin to congratulate him on his re-election as President of the Russian Federation. Xi Jinping said that Putin's re-election fully demonstrated the Russian people's support for him. He stressed that China attaches great importance to the development of China-Russia relations and is willing to maintain close communication with Russia to promote the sustained, healthy, stable and in-depth development of the China-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination for a new era.\nAccording to the KCNA report on the 18th, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un also sent a congratulatory message to Putin. Also congratulating the Russian President on his re-election were Venezuelan President Maduro, as well as the national leaders of Nicaragua and Tajikistan.\nAccording to exit polls, Putin received nearly 88% of the vote. After the results came out, Putin held a press conference in Moscow to thank the Russian people for their support and once again threatened NATO with a \"world war.\"\nWhen asked by reporters about the risks and possibilities of conflict between Russia and NATO, Putin responded that \"everything is possible in the modern world.\" He said: \"Everyone knows that (if there is a conflict between NATO and Russia), it is only one step away from World War III. I don't think anyone wants to see this situation.\"\nPutin also said that Moscow knew that NATO troops were deployed in Ukraine. But he did not provide clear evidence, only saying that the Russian army heard people speaking English and French on the battlefield.\nWestern countries have accused Russia of lacking free and fair presidential elections. A spokesman for the White House National Security Council said on Sunday that Russian President Vladimir Putin \"has imprisoned his political opponents and prevented others from running against him\" and that the presidential election was \"clearly neither free nor fair.\"\nThe German Foreign Ministry\u2019s \"The so-called 'elections' conducted by Russia in the occupied territories of Ukraine are invalid and once again violate international law.\"\nA spokesman for the German president confirmed to Berlin's Tagesspiegel that Federal President Steinmeier would not send a letter to congratulate Putin on his election. When Putin was last re-elected in 2018, Steinmeier congratulated him.\nThe French Foreign Ministry pointed out that Putin's re-election took place against the background of repression of civil society and praised \"the courage of the many Russian people who peacefully protested against the violation of their basic political rights.\"\nBritish Foreign Secretary Cameron also criticized Russia's election on Sunday as lacking \"free and fair\". Cameron posted on the X platform that the \"illegal\" election held on Ukrainian soil showed that Russia is not interested in finding a path to peace.\n\"Russia's presidential election was illegitimate, not free and unfair,\" Poland's Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Sunday, saying the vote was taking place \"in the context of severe repression\" in occupied Ukraine. The move violated international law.\nUkrainian President Zelensky said that Putin \"has once again simulated an election\" and believed that Putin would do whatever it takes \"in order to maintain his personal power.\" Zelensky said the \"Russian dictator\" must be sent to the International Criminal Court in The Hague.\n(comprehensive report)\n\u00a9 2024 Deutsche Welle Copyright Statement: All contents of this article are protected by copyright law and may not be used without special authorization from Deutsche Welle.

The total number of polling stations will reach 288. In the 2018 presidential election, Russia set up 394 polling stations overseas. Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zakharova said that the security situation at Russian embassies and consulates has deteriorated significantly recently, and not all European and American countries have responded to Russia\u2019s note requesting to ensure the security of polling stations on election day. Regarding the reduction of overseas polling stations, Andreev also said that this is not Russia\u2019s fault, but the fault of the country where the polling stations are located.","uid":"03_07_38","input":"For Russian overseas voters, the head of the Russian embassy abroad can change the start, end and duration of voting depending on the situation.\nThe law also clearly stipulates that only authorized personnel can take photos and videos at polling sites, and media reporters with formal work contracts can be certified at polling stations.

Kremlin, despite foreign criticism of the entire process, David Kankia, an expert with the Voice movement, said in a commentary for the Russian service of the Voice of America. According to him, this pleases the pride of the authorities and supposedly proves that all decisions made in recent years are supported by the majority of society.\n\n\u201cIn fact, elections are held primarily not because, as stated in the Constitution, it is necessary to identify the will of the people and on the basis of this to form power structures, but because an inverted pyramid has been established in the country,\u201d he clarified. \u2013 For the authorities, this is another reason to check how loyal the population and the bureaucratic apparatus are to it, \u201cdarling\u201d, and how ready the latter is to fulfill any assigned tasks. In fact, the population and the bureaucracy are tested before the incubator (the current holder of the position - V.V.), and not vice versa.\u201d\n\nIf the Kremlin\u2019s goal was to \u201cplease\u201d Vladimir Putin, then it has been realized, David Kankia also stated: \u201cIf the goal was to convince someone of the legitimacy of the elections, it seems to me that this is very far away. Everything that we saw during the election campaign on voting days, as well as the international reaction to this and the interest, for example, in the materials and analytics of Golos, suggests that an alternative point of view is still in demand in Russia. And those who doubted the integrity of the electoral procedure carried out in the Russian Federation only strengthened their opinion.\u201d\n\nIn addition, it became clear that those who do not want to receive alternative information will not receive it, the expert continued: \u201cNow, in fact, there are two Russias, which exist in two different information spaces with different agendas, and they have completely different visions elections. People who were forced to come to polling stations and vote involuntarily, as well as members of the commission who rewrote protocols in violation of the law, understand perfectly well the real cost of such elections. Just like the presidential administration, which had a hand in all this.\u201d\n\nBut the current owner of the Kremlin is probably pleased - at least he obviously believes that everything is in his power, everyone can be forced to dance to his tune and even pretend that they believe in the interest rates presented, David Kankia summarized.\n\nAs a result of the presidential campaign, the Russian authorities achieved everything they wanted, says political scientist Fyodor Krasheninnikov. In his opinion, they are not at all confused by the methods by which the desired results were obtained.\n\n\u201cNow they will interpret any nuance in their favor,\u201d he added in a comment to Voice of America. \u2013 For example, there are no elections in Ukraine, but they took place in Russia. Therefore, the Kremlin will say that Putin is legitimate, but Zelensky is not. In addition, there are doubts about the election results outside, not inside Russia. Inside, any \u201csedition\u201d is mercilessly suppressed. But the authorities and propaganda will tirelessly repeat that Putin was legitimately elected, and with an overwhelming advantage.\u201d\n\nThe excessively high percentage for Putin is explained by the fact that the Kremlin is convinced that during a war, the entire people should unite around the leader, believes Fyodor Krasheninnikov: \u201cAlthough it is clear that the record result was achieved solely due to unprecedented falsifications. Not only is electronic voting an uncontrollable abyss, but it has also been revealed that tens of millions of people, many of whom most likely do not exist at all, or those who simply did not go to the polls, nevertheless \u201cexpressed their will\u201d as they should. The same applies to voting in the occupied Ukrainian territories. Everyone there was en masse enrolling as voters. Thus, it is generally impossible to analyze these elections taking into account the huge number of attributions and other frauds.\u201d\n\nOf course, many people voted for Putin, but, of course, not in such absurd numbers, the political scientist concluded.\n\nVladimir Putin's inauguration is scheduled for May 7 this year.

But not China | CNN","stance":"neg","content":" A sanctions-battered government in Iran, which has been expanding its cooperation with Russia and providing it with drones and ammunition, also gains from a continuation of the Putin era.\n    \n\n            Even India, while tightening ties with the US and calling for peace in Ukraine, has benefited from continuing exchanges with Russia, especially through its purchase of discounted oil.\n    \n\n            Other governments across the Global South have also looked to bolster partnerships with Russia, even as they back peace in Ukraine and have suffered from knock-on economic impacts of the war.\n    \n\n            While the Russian election was no contest, Putin\u2019s ability to maintain his iron grip on power and reach this point without a defeat in Ukraine has not been a sure bet.\n    \n\n            The Russian leader has weathered an apparent miscalculation that what his government still calls a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d in Ukraine would be a swift success.

If it is confirmed that the detainees actually carried out the order of Ukrainian curators, they may face Article 275 (\u201cTreason\u201d) of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.

He believes that China is achieving rapid development with great confidence and transforming into an innovative economy; China is increasingly active on the international stage and has achieved great success, and has many friends around the world.\nPutin emphasized that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China; those attempts to provoke provocations around Taiwan and take various measures to retard China's development will undoubtedly fail completely.\nAccording to data released by the Russian Central Election Commission in the early morning of the 18th local time, of the 85% of votes that have been counted in this presidential election, Putin is significantly ahead of other candidates with 87.19% of the votes, and has actually won the presidential election.\nThe official voting for Russia\u2019s eighth presidential election will be held from the 15th to the 17th. According to Russian presidential election rules, the person who gets more than 50% of the votes is elected president. The Russian Central Election Commission will confirm the final results of the presidential election no later than March 28 and announce them within 3 days after the election results are confirmed."}

is reported that Putin, who was re-elected in the Russian presidential election, will first visit Beijing after taking office in May. Putin also recently stated that Russia and China share similar global views and that the relationship between Moscow and Beijing will further develop in the next few years. But Putin's victory was criticized by Western countries as an undemocratic election.\nNews of Putin's upcoming visit to China was disclosed by Reuters on Tuesday, citing five unnamed people. The report also emphasized that this may be Putin's first overseas visit in his new term.\nHowever, at present, the specific itinerary of Putin's visit to China is not known to the outside world. The Kremlin told Reuters the exact time would be announced later.\nPutin surpasses Stalin\nThe outside world was not surprised that Putin was \"elected\" again. Putin received about 87% of the vote in the election, his highest share of the vote in any Russian presidential election, according to Russia's Central Election Commission.\nAl Jazeera pointed out in the report that this result also means that the 71-year-old Putin will surpass the former leader of the Soviet Communist Party Stalin and become the longest-serving leader of Russia in more than 200 years.\nWestern society has also generally expressed criticism of this Russian election. A spokesman for the White House Security Council said on Monday that the election was clearly neither free nor fair given that Putin imprisoned political opponents and prevented others from competing against him.\nThe U.S. State Department also issued a statement on Tuesday stressing that the Kremlin conducted a sham presidential election in areas temporarily occupied by Ukraine, which was actually a propaganda campaign designed to strengthen Russia's illegitimate claims that it illegally occupied parts of Ukraine.\nBritish Foreign Secretary David Cameron posted on social media X that the Russian election vote \"is not a free and fair election.\"\nBut leaders from China, North Korea, Iran and India, among others, congratulated Putin. Chinese leader Xi Jinping said in his congratulatory message that Putin's re-election fully demonstrated the Russian people's support for him. He also said that China attaches great importance to the development of China-Russia relations and is willing to maintain close communication with Russia to promote the sustained, healthy, stable and in-depth development of the China-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination for a new era.\nA similar worldview\nPutin\u2019s positioning on Russia-China relations seems to be highly consistent with Xi Jinping\u2019s. According to Reuters, on Sunday (March 17), the day after the election, Putin told the media that Russia and China share a similar global outlook and enjoy a strong relationship, partly due to his good personal relationship with Xi Jinping, Moscow and Beijing will further develop relations in the coming years.\n\n\nThe report pointed out that Putin and Xi Jinping have similar world views. They both believe that the West is declining; and China is also challenging the hegemony of the United States in various fields such as technology, espionage and hard power.\nSimilar to Putin, Xi Jinping broke with convention at last year's National People's Congress and began his third term as president. It is generally estimated by the outside world that Xi Jinping is likely to be re-elected. Putin's \"election\" this time is also within the framework of Russia's new constitution. Chinese media Caixin pointed out in a report that this election paves the way for Putin to seek re-election in 2030.\nIt is worth noting that after Xi Jinping was re-elected in March last year, he also set the destination of his first overseas visit in Moscow.\nThere are various signs that the bilateral trade relations between China and Russia continue to develop. According to data from China Customs, the bilateral trade volume of goods and services between China and Russia in 2023 will be US$240.1 billion, a year-on-year increase of 26.3% from 2022. The amount exceeds the annual target set by the two countries for bilateral trade to exceed US$200 billion by 2024.\nLast month, on the eve of the Chinese Lunar New Year, Xi Jinping specifically emphasized during a phone call with Putin that the two sides should intensify strategic coordination, defend their respective national sovereignty, security, and development interests, and resolutely oppose external forces interfering in internal affairs. Reuters pointed out in the report that this was an allusion to the United States.\nOn the issue of the Russia-Ukraine war, China has always taken a vague stance. In January this year, Switzerland proposed hosting a peace conference in Ukraine, but did not intend to invite Russia to participate. The Kremlin said the meeting was meaningless and destined to fail. So far, China has not made a clear response to this.\nWang Shiting, Chinese Ambassador to Switzerland, told the Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung on Monday (March 18): China is paying close attention to the Ukraine conference that Switzerland will host and is studying the possibility of participating. However, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian stated at a press conference on Tuesday (March 19) that China supports the timely convening of an international peace conference recognized by Russia and Ukraine, with equal participation by all parties, and fair discussion of all peace plans.","uid":"03_00_73","input":"It is reported that Putin, who was re-elected in the Russian presidential election, will first visit Beijing after taking office in May.

Central Election Commission summed up the results of the presidential election. The number of votes cast for Vladimir Putin in the country does not reach 90%, and in some regions it has exceeded this mark. An unprecedented turnout was also recorded. The main figures, trends, records are in the Kommersant material.\n\nRecord turnout\nAccording to the head of the Central Election Commission of the Russian Federation, Ella Pamfilova, the turnout in the presidential elections of the Russian Federation in 2024 was a record in the modern history of Russia. It amounted to 77.49% (87.6 million voters). Before this, the 70 percent mark was exceeded only once - in 1991.\n\nThe turnout at overseas sites was also significant. According to inconclusive data announced by the Russian Foreign Ministry, at least 372 thousand people voted. In the last elections, 474 thousand Russians voted abroad, but there were significantly more polling stations then - 401 versus 295.\n\nThe top Russian regions in terms of turnout are headed by Chechnya, the lowest figure is in the Komi Republic.\n\nThe final turnout on the federal DEG platform is 94%. This voting method was used by 4.4 million people in 28 regions. In Moscow, which uses its platform, almost 3.7 million people, or half of all voters, voted online.\n\nThe turnout among military personnel of the Russian Armed Forces was 99.8%. Polar explorers demonstrated 100% turnout at all stations and scientific expedition vessels in the Arctic and Antarctic. In Moscow pre-trial detention centers, almost 100% voted, everyone who expressed a desire. In total, 77 thousand people in custody and about 40 thousand people who have restrictions and prohibitions that prevent them from visiting polling stations exercised their rights in the FSIN system.\n\nOutstanding results\nAfter processing 100% of the protocols, Vladimir Putin scored 87.28% (76.3 million votes). He improved his last result by more than 10 percentage points, or 19.9 million votes.\n\nChechnya returned to first place in the top regions that provided the greatest support to the current president. The leader of 2018, Kabardino-Balkaria, is in fifth place. In addition, the top ten includes Crimea, Sevastopol and three out of four new regions. In the fourth, Kherson region, Vladimir Putin also received an impressive 88.12%, but for all participants in the top 10 his result was over 90%, and in Chechnya it was generally close to 100% (98.99%).","uid":"00_08_19","input":"The Russian Central Election Commission summed up the results of the presidential election.

to the Russian federal budget plan, Russia's defense spending in 2024 will increase by nearly 70% compared with 2023. Defense and security spending combined are expected to account for about 40% of all budget spending. This is the first time that Russia's military spending has exceeded social spending. .\nThe substantial growth in defense spending and manufacturing related to military operations has largely played a role in promoting Russia's economic development. According to Russian official data, as of the end of 2023, Russia's GDP will increase by 3.6% compared with 2022. In addition to growing consumer demand and increasing adaptation to Western sanctions, the growth of manufacturing is also an important driver of Russia's economic growth.\nAccording to estimates by Alexander Isakov, an economist at VTB Capital, manufacturing growth will contribute 1.2 percentage points to Russia\u2019s GDP growth in 2023, and about half of this will come from companies closest to the military-industrial complex. Metal, electronic equipment and transportation manufacturing and other fields.\nAgainst this background, Russian military-industrial enterprises\u2019 demand for personnel has increased rapidly. Putin said in February this year that the Russian military-industrial complex currently includes 6,000 companies with a total of 3.5 million employees. In just one and a half years, the Russian military-industrial complex has created 520,000 new jobs.\nAccording to Yuri, since the main buyers of steel are still Western countries and military demand is relatively small, his company's overall turnover has still declined to a certain extent. However, Yuri's salary did not decrease as a result. On the contrary, his income is increasing. Yuri explained that this is inseparable from the labor shortage problem that Russia is currently facing.\nAs one of the early people affected by Russia's delayed retirement policy and a practitioner in military-related industries, 56-year-old Yuri has a deep understanding of Russia's long-term demographic crisis and the current labor shortage. He was supposed to retire at the age of 60, but now he still needs to continue working for 9 years.\nYuri mentioned that continuing to work after retirement is very common in Russia. This way people can earn more money on top of their pension. After delaying retirement, the time during which they can receive \"double salary\" is shortened.\nIn addition to the demographic crisis, Russia's labor shortage has become increasingly serious due to the impact of military mobilization after the Russian-Ukrainian conflict and a new wave of \"immigration.\" According to a latest research report released by the Russian Academy of Sciences, Russia's labor gap will reach 4.8 million people in 2023, and this problem is becoming a constraint on Russia's economic development.\n\"The shortage of labor forces employers to pay higher wages in order to retain employees.\" Yuri explained.\nAccording to relevant data on the Russian labor market, the current salary levels of mechanics, welders and other employees in Russian military factories have exceeded that of many ordinary white-collar workers. In pursuit of better treatment, personnel previously engaged in civilian production are moving to related companies in the machinery manufacturing field, including the military industry sector.

According to Baza, the woman is 64 years old and her arm was torn off.\nIn St. Petersburg on Friday, a girl threw a Molotov cocktail at the sign of one of the precinct commissions, said the head of the local election commission, Maxim Meiksin. The fire was put out.\nIn addition, in Kogalym, Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous Okrug, a woman tried to set fire to a stationary ballot box using a Molotov cocktail (video footage from the polling station is below). She was detained and the fire was extinguished. The ballots and equipment were not damaged, the press service of the Ugra Electoral Commission clarified.\n\nIn the south-east of Moscow, a woman at one of the polling stations set fire to a voting booth with a flammable liquid, the Investigative Committee reported. A criminal case has been initiated under Art. 141 (obstruction of the work of election commissions).\nAt another polling station in Moscow, a girl poured a dye into a ballot box.

According to Deputy Chairman of the Moscow City Election Commission Dmitry Reut, there were about 100 ballots in this ballot box.\n\nOn the morning of March 15, similar incidents occurred in Borisoglebsk in the Voronezh region. According to Notebook Borisoglebsk, trash cans in the South-Eastern and Northern microdistricts of the city were filled with green paint. The Borisoglebsk TEC reported that members of the precinct commission sealed the slots in the boxes and installed other ballot boxes, and voting continued. They will later check to see if the colored ballots can be considered valid.\nIn Yekaterinburg, a professor at the Ural Federal University, Emilia Nosova, tried to spoil the ballots at one of the city\u2019s polling stations. She had some brilliant green with her. A Ura.ru source in law enforcement agencies claims that the UrFU professor came to the polling station with brilliant green under pressure from unknown persons, to whom she had previously transferred 15 million rubles.","uid":"00_08_52","input":"Incidents during voting\nThe Electoral Commission of the Kherson region on Friday reported attacks on premises in the city of Kakhovka and in the village of Brilyovka, Aleshkinsky district, where precinct commissions were located. \u201cWe managed to avoid casualties in Kakhovka.

presidential election enters its final day on Sunday (March 17), with Kremlin critics calling for mass protests at Russian polling stations.\n\nThe vote that will consolidate the power of Russian President Vladimir Putin has been rocky, marked by a surge in bombings in Ukraine, incursions by pro-Ukrainian sabotage groups and a series of incidents at polling stations. Some people poured dye into ballot boxes, some tried to burn ballot boxes, and bombs exploded outside polling stations. Many people were arrested in various places.\n\nRussian lawmakers have proposed a new law that would punish election saboteurs with up to eight years in prison.\n\nAlexey Navalny, a Russian opposition politician who organized massive anti-Putin rallies, died in an Arctic prison last month. He had urged Russians to stage protests on the final day of voting.\n\n\u201cAnti-Putin at noon\u201d\n\nNavalny's supporters launched an action called \"Noon Against Putin\" (Noon Against Putin), calling on people to vote collectively at the polling stations at noon on Sunday to express their opposition to Putin.\n\nNavalny's widow, Yulia Navalnaya, expressed support for the action. This is a legal queue to vote without fear of arrest, and you can express your opposition. She called on protesters to show up in large numbers at once and overwhelm polling places. She also called on protesters to write \"Navalny\" on their ballots or vote for a candidate other than Putin.\n\nMoscow authorities have repeatedly warned people not to participate in dissident activities. A Russian citizen in his 20s told AFP that he would participate in a voting protest in Moscow at 12 noon local time on Sunday, \"just to see the supportive young faces around him... to feel some support and see this A ray of light in a dark tunnel.\u201d\n\nThe man declined to be named for security reasons. He said he hoped the protest would show authorities that \"there are people in this country who are against this conflict (in Ukraine) and against this regime.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian drone and missile strikes hit Russia again. On Saturday (March 16), Ukraine launched a new wave of bombings in Belgorod, which borders Ukraine, killing two people. The Russian Defense Ministry also said it foiled an attempt by \"Ukrainian sabotage and reconnaissance groups\" to enter the country from Ukraine's Sumy region.\n\nOn Sunday, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced that its air defense forces intercepted and destroyed 35 Ukrainian drones in eight areas, one of which caused a fire at an oil refinery.\n\nPutin has vowed to respond harshly to the attacks and accused Ukraine of trying to \"sabotage\" his bid for another term in office.\n\nPutin, 71, has been in power since 1999 and has spent the past two decades building a system of domestic repression and confrontation with the West.\n\nRussian authorities have previously banned two candidates who oppose the Russo-Ukrainian war from running. Without any real opponents, Putin is almost certain to win this election. And because the constitutional amendment extended the term, if Putin wins as expected, he will serve for another six years, at least until 2030.\n\nThe former KGB agent is already the longest-serving Russian leader since Soviet-era leader Joseph Stalin.\n\nIn a speech on the eve of the election, Putin said that Russia was going through a \"difficult period.\"\n\n\"We need to continue to be united and confident,\" he said, describing the election as a way for Russians to show their \"patriotism.\"\n\nVoting was also held in five occupied regions of eastern Ukraine that Russia claims to have annexed, including the Crimean peninsula.\n\nVoting will close at 18:00 GMT on March 17, with exit polls expected to be announced shortly.\n\nAccording to Russia's Central Election Commission, more than 63 million voters had gone to the polls as of Saturday evening.","uid":"03_00_60","input":"Russia's presidential election enters its final day on Sunday (March 17), with Kremlin critics calling for mass protests at Russian polling stations.\n\nThe vote that will consolidate the power of Russian President Vladimir Putin has been rocky, marked by a surge in bombings in Ukraine, incursions by pro-Ukrainian sabotage groups and a series of incidents at polling stations.

A Russian citizen in his 20s told AFP that he would participate in a voting protest in Moscow at 12 noon local time on Sunday, \"just to see the supportive young faces around him... to feel some support and see this A ray of light in a dark tunnel.\u201d\n\nThe man declined to be named for security reasons. He said he hoped the protest would show authorities that \"there are people in this country who are against this conflict (in Ukraine) and against this regime.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian drone and missile strikes hit Russia again. On Saturday (March 16), Ukraine launched a new wave of bombings in Belgorod, which borders Ukraine, killing two people. The Russian Defense Ministry also said it foiled an attempt by \"Ukrainian sabotage and reconnaissance groups\" to enter the country from Ukraine's Sumy region.\n\nOn Sunday, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced that its air defense forces intercepted and destroyed 35 Ukrainian drones in eight areas, one of which caused a fire at an oil refinery.\n\nPutin has vowed to respond harshly to the attacks and accused Ukraine of trying to \"sabotage\" his bid for another term in office.\n\nPutin, 71, has been in power since 1999 and has spent the past two decades building a system of domestic repression and confrontation with the West.\n\nRussian authorities have previously banned two candidates who oppose the Russo-Ukrainian war from running. Without any real opponents, Putin is almost certain to win this election. And because the constitutional amendment extended the term, if Putin wins as expected, he will serve for another six years, at least until 2030.\n\nThe former KGB agent is already the longest-serving Russian leader since Soviet-era leader Joseph Stalin.\n\nIn a speech on the eve of the election, Putin said that Russia was going through a \"difficult period.\"\n\n\"We need to continue to be united and confident,\" he said, describing the election as a way for Russians to show their \"patriotism.\"\n\nVoting was also held in five occupied regions of eastern Ukraine that Russia claims to have annexed, including the Crimean peninsula.\n\nVoting will close at 18:00 GMT on March 17, with exit polls expected to be announced shortly.\n\nAccording to Russia's Central Election Commission, more than 63 million voters had gone to the polls as of Saturday evening."}

Epoch Times, March 16, 2024] (Comprehensive report by Epoch Times reporter Chen Ting) An independent voting monitoring organization warned that this Russian election will be the most opaque election in the country\u2019s history. Current President Vladimir Putin is widely expected to win re-election in the general election.\nStanislav Andreichuk, co-chairman of the election watchdog group Golos, said the use of electronic voting for the first time in a general election and the fact that voting was spread over three days made the electoral process even more opaque.\n\"This is the most closed and opaque election in Russia's history,\" Andreychuk told Reuters in an interview.\nThe Kremlin says the election, which begins on Friday, is a properly democratic process and predicts Putin will win based on overwhelming popular support.\nThe Russian election agency stated that this election will be supervised by 706 foreign observers. In addition, as many as 1\/3 of the 1 million Russian observers nominated by candidates, political parties and social organizations will participate in supervision.\nAndreychuk said the high turnout on the first day of the election reflected workplace supervisors putting pressure on people to ensure they went to the polls.\nHe said: \"Everyone goes out to vote first thing in the morning because their boss wants them to. Because it's a working day, it's easy to track their whereabouts.\"\nSix sources told Reuters on the eve of the election that executives at state-owned companies and organizations were pressuring employees to vote. Some will also have to provide evidence that they voted, four of them said.\nAn employee of a state-owned enterprise said: \"In our factory, everyone was told to vote on March 15 and send a selfie to the boss.\"\nThe high turnout is important to the Kremlin as Putin wants to show that the country still supports him two years after the start of the Russo-Ukrainian war.\nOfficial data showed that the national turnout on Friday exceeded 33%, but it exceeded 60% in Siberia and the Far East. In the Russian-occupied Donetsk and Kherson regions of Ukraine, the turnout was closer to 70%.\nSupporters of opposition politician Alexei Navalny, who died in an Arctic prison last month, are urging people to vote en masse at noon on Sunday in protest.\nAndreichuk said that in this general election, people in about one-third of the country can vote electronically. He believes this is a particular concern because it is easily manipulated and the results of the vote cannot be checked.\nHe also said that the voting time span was as long as three days, so the results could be tampered with overnight.\nAndreichuk also criticized the fact that there were only three candidates besides Putin, the smallest number of contenders in the past five elections, and that public discussion of national issues was not allowed.\n\"The authorities implemented censorship, there was repression in the country, and some opponents were sent to prison. Therefore, this election was not free and undemocratic from the beginning,\" Andreychuk said.\nGolos were prohibited from sending observers. In 2013, \"Voice\" was deemed a \"foreign agent\" by the authorities because it published evidence of fraud in the 2011 parliamentary election and the 2012 presidential election.","uid":"03_00_91","input":"[The Epoch Times, March 16, 2024] (Comprehensive report by Epoch Times reporter Chen Ting) An independent voting monitoring organization warned that this Russian election will be the most opaque election in the country\u2019s history.

The Belgorod region of Russia was shelled by the Ukrainian army on the 16th, and many cars were blown up. \\Associated Press\nThe official voting for Russia\u2019s eighth presidential election will be held from March 15 to 17. Data from the Russian Central Election Commission show that as of about 4 p.m. Moscow time on the 17th, the turnout rate for this election has exceeded 70%. However, since the beginning of voting, there have been about 280,000 cyber attacks against electronic voting systems, with the attacks mainly originating from Ukraine, Western Europe and North America. In addition, on the Russian-Ukrainian battlefield, the Ukrainian army continued to use drones and missiles to attack Russian territory, and even shelled polling stations in an attempt to interfere with the election.\nVoting for this general election is scheduled to end at 20:00 Moscow time on the 17th. As of about four hours before the end of voting, the turnout had exceeded 70%, which was higher than the 67.5% turnout in the 2018 general election. Pamfilova, chairwoman of the Russian Central Election Commission, said that 1,115 international observers and experts from 129 countries are monitoring the voting.\nA total of four candidates participated in this presidential election, including current Russian President Vladimir Putin, Slutsky of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, Kharitonov of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, and Davankov of the New People's Party of Russia. After Russia's 2020 referendum to amend the constitution, the number of presidential terms will be reset to zero, allowing Putin to serve two more terms from 2024 to 2036. Putin is expected to be elected with a high vote.\nMedvedev calls election saboteurs \u201ctraitors\u201d\nThis election used remote electronic voting for the first time. Pamfilova said on the 17th that since the start of online voting on the 15th, authorities have intercepted approximately 280,000 malicious distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against electronic voting systems. Data from Russian Telecom showed that the voting system suffered more than 90,000 attacks on the 15th.\nLapunov, the company\u2019s vice president for information security, pointed out that the source IP addresses of these network attacks are mainly located in Ukraine, Western Europe and North America. He also pointed out that judging from the professionalism of cyber attacks, these attacks were launched by \"professional special organizations.\" The Russian Foreign Intelligence Service said in a statement that the United States was trying to undermine the election results by reducing voter turnout. \"Instigated by Washington, the opposition is spreading calls on Russian citizens to ignore the election through Internet resources.\"\nIn addition, during the voting period, there were more than 20 incidents of attempts to destroy ballots by pouring various liquids into ballot boxes, 8 attempted arson incidents, and 1 incident of throwing smoke bombs at various polling stations, resulting in 214 ballots being destroyed. Several people were arrested for vandalism at polling stations.\nPamfilova accused these saboteurs of being \"scum\" and \"destroyed people's votes\", and revealed that some saboteurs admitted to being instructed by others to deliberately disrupt the election, and were paid as much as 100,000 rubles (approximately HK$8,500). Former Russian President Medvedev called these people \"traitors\", accused them of helping the country's enemies, and said that the perpetrators may have committed treason and may face 20 years in prison. Some members of Congress have proposed legislation that would punish those who disrupt election activities with up to eight years in prison.\nUkrainian army steps up attacks on targets in Russia\nIn addition to the cyber battlefield, Ukraine has repeatedly attacked oil refineries in Russia since before the election and sent troops to try to break through the Russian border.

Data from the Russian Central Election Commission show that as of about 4 p.m. Moscow time on the 17th, the turnout rate for this election has exceeded 70%. However, since the beginning of voting, there have been about 280,000 cyber attacks against electronic voting systems, with the attacks mainly originating from Ukraine, Western Europe and North America. In addition, on the Russian-Ukrainian battlefield, the Ukrainian army continued to use drones and missiles to attack Russian territory, and even shelled polling stations in an attempt to interfere with the election.\nVoting for this general election is scheduled to end at 20:00 Moscow time on the 17th. As of about four hours before the end of voting, the turnout had exceeded 70%, which was higher than the 67.5% turnout in the 2018 general election. Pamfilova, chairwoman of the Russian Central Election Commission, said that 1,115 international observers and experts from 129 countries are monitoring the voting.\nA total of four candidates participated in this presidential election, including current Russian President Vladimir Putin, Slutsky of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, Kharitonov of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, and Davankov of the New People's Party of Russia. After Russia's 2020 referendum to amend the constitution, the number of presidential terms will be reset to zero, allowing Putin to serve two more terms from 2024 to 2036. Putin is expected to be elected with a high vote.\nMedvedev calls election saboteurs \u201ctraitors\u201d\nThis election used remote electronic voting for the first time. Pamfilova said on the 17th that since the start of online voting on the 15th, authorities have intercepted approximately 280,000 malicious distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against electronic voting systems. Data from Russian Telecom showed that the voting system suffered more than 90,000 attacks on the 15th.\nLapunov, the company\u2019s vice president for information security, pointed out that the source IP addresses of these network attacks are mainly located in Ukraine, Western Europe and North America. He also pointed out that judging from the professionalism of cyber attacks, these attacks were launched by \"professional special organizations.\" The Russian Foreign Intelligence Service said in a statement that the United States was trying to undermine the election results by reducing voter turnout. \"Instigated by Washington, the opposition is spreading calls on Russian citizens to ignore the election through Internet resources.\"\nIn addition, during the voting period, there were more than 20 incidents of attempts to destroy ballots by pouring various liquids into ballot boxes, 8 attempted arson incidents, and 1 incident of throwing smoke bombs at various polling stations, resulting in 214 ballots being destroyed. Several people were arrested for vandalism at polling stations.\nPamfilova accused these saboteurs of being \"scum\" and \"destroyed people's votes\", and revealed that some saboteurs admitted to being instructed by others to deliberately disrupt the election, and were paid as much as 100,000 rubles (approximately HK$8,500). Former Russian President Medvedev called these people \"traitors\", accused them of helping the country's enemies, and said that the perpetrators may have committed treason and may face 20 years in prison. Some members of Congress have proposed legislation that would punish those who disrupt election activities with up to eight years in prison.\nUkrainian army steps up attacks on targets in Russia\nIn addition to the cyber battlefield, Ukraine has repeatedly attacked oil refineries in Russia since before the election and sent troops to try to break through the Russian border. The Russian Ministry of Defense stated on the 17th that it had shot down 23 Ukrainian \"Vampire\" rockets and 168 drones in the past 24 hours alone.\nRussian Presidential Press Secretary Peskov said that the Ukrainian army has attempted to invade Belgorod and Kursk regions several times in recent days, but all attacks have been successfully repelled. \u201c1,700 of the 2,500 saboteurs were killed, 550 Loss of life\".
