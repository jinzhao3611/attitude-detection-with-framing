For two years, Sasha rarely had a vacation, was separated from his family for long periods of time, and is still fighting on the front lines.\nAs the conflict drags on, the treatment of frontline soldiers has become a matter of concern to all walks of life in Russia. In February 2023, Putin stated in his State of the Union address that considering that participants in special military operations face tremendous physical and psychological pressure and face risks to their health and life every day, they should be provided with medical assistance at least once every six months and every day. A regular leave of at least 14 days so that each soldier has the opportunity to visit relatives and friends.\nIn June of that year, Putin signed an order to distribute free land to participants of special military operations who were awarded the title of \"Hero of Russia\" and other medals, as well as veterans who participated in the operations. The order does not apply to Moscow, St. Petersburg and Sevastopol in the Crimea region, but Putin requested other social support packages there.\nIn February 2024, Putin once again emphasized in his State of the Union address on the eve of the Russian presidential election that Russia's future will largely depend on the courage and determination of soldiers participating in special military operations. They should serve in education, business and state administration. Holding a leadership position will give priority to higher education and professional education at first-class universities, and priority for promotion in the Russian Armed Forces.\nWhenever he talks about war, Andre's feelings are always very complicated and contradictory. He admitted that some people voluntarily went to the front line, some of them for generous rewards. But in his opinion, people will not go to the front line where the shadow of death is looming just because of money.\nAs for his friends, Andre said reluctantly that he had no choice, but he also knew his mission.\nCompared to Sasha, who has been fighting on the front line, Andre's other friend Ilya seems to be luckier. A few years ago, Ilya entered the army to perform compulsory military service after completing 11th grade courses. Ilya is an excellent boxer. Due to his good physical fitness and good treatment in the army, Ilya became a contract soldier after completing his compulsory military service.\nBefore February 2022, Ilya left the army after his contract expired and was therefore not sent to the front line, while one of his comrades had just extended his contract a few months before the war. Unfortunately, Ilya's comrade died on the front line from a shrapnel that penetrated his stomach. He was only 25 years old when he died.\n\"Ilya went to the funeral of his comrade and he was very sad. The war was terrible, people were dying on both sides...

It has gradually moved from fantasy to rationality and pragmatism.\n\nAt the beginning of Putin's rule, he devoted himself to the West. At their core, Russians yearn for the West and return to Europe. In the early days of Putin's administration, he wanted to use the assistance of the United States and Western countries to revitalize Russia and build a strong world. He first visited more than 10 European countries including the United Kingdom. After the \"9.11\" incident, Putin was the first to call the then US President George W. Bush to express his firm support for the US's fight against terrorism. Subsequently, it provided more assistance to the United States than the total number of NATO member states except the United Kingdom, provided relevant intelligence to the United States in a timely manner, persuaded Central Asian countries to open \"air corridors\" for US and British military operations, and allowed the US military to use military bases in Central Asian countries. .....Putin\u2019s various good deeds were rewarded with lip service from the United States and Western countries but no real results.\n\nRussia suffered a loss in its diplomacy with the United States and Western countries and was deceived. It promptly returned to the \"double-headed eagle\" diplomatic policy and turned to balancing the East and the West. While maintaining normal diplomacy with Western countries, it focused on China and India, the two major powers, and established a relationship with China. China has established a comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination for a new era, maintained and developed traditional friendly exchanges with India, and achieved gratifying results.\n\nIn 2014, in order to prevent the expansion of the threat of NATO's eastward expansion, Russia decisively took back Crimea, and Russia's relations with the United States and Spain fell into a low point. Since the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the United States and Western countries have increased their suppression, sanctions and blockade against Russia. Russia timely turned to a comprehensive \"Look East\", using China as the fulcrum of diplomacy, using the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, BRICS and the Collective Security Treaty Organization as platforms, carrying out active and flexible diplomacy, strengthening exchanges with North Korea, ASEAN and other countries, and taking into account all matters in a timely manner.

The country will further move forward and become stronger, stronger and more efficient. Regarding the negative reaction from Western countries, Putin said: \"This is expected. Can you expect them to stand up and applaud?\" He also said that the U.S. government is using its power and resources to attack a presidential candidate, and the atmosphere of the U.S. election campaign is becoming increasingly uncivilized and \u201cthe whole world is laughing at what\u2019s happening in America.\u201d Russian media said that the US presidential candidate mentioned by Putin was Trump.\nWhen talking about the challenges facing the new term, Putin said that Russia must complete its special military operations in Ukraine.

While Putin is deeply involved in the war in Ukraine and Russia is sanctioned by Western society, the economic complementarity between Russia and China is now higher than before.\nThe Russia-Ukraine war, which has lasted for more than two years, is still in a stalemate. Last month, China confirmed that Putin will visit China again this year. This will be Putin's 19th visit to China since taking power in Russia.\nAccording to statistics from the General Administration of Customs of the Communist Party of China, in 2022, the bilateral trade volume between China and Russia reached a record high of 190.27 billion U.S. dollars, a year-on-year increase of 29.3%. When the Russo-Ukrainian war broke out and Russia faced sanctions from Western societies, China became Russia's most important trading partner.\nAfter the Russian presidential election, Putin warned on March 18 that if Russia had a direct conflict with NATO, it would be only one step away from the so-called World War III. The European Union issued another warning to Putin and determined to continue supporting Ukraine.\nLai Rongwei said that anyone can say cruel things like Putin, just like Kim Jong-un who talks about blowing up South Korea all day long. This is just a kind of intimidation. But the international community must also unite and collectively deter it. Just like Taiwan wants to deter the CCP, the best way is to unite all Taiwanese friends.\nOn March 22, 2023, Xi Jinping ended his three-day visit to Russia. When leaving the Kremlin, he said something to Putin, saying that \"we will promote the so-called changes in a century together.\" Putin responded in agreement. At that time, outsiders believed that what Xi was hinting at was an attempt to join forces to disrupt the \"world order.\"\nLai Rongwei said that the two authoritarian regimes of China and Russia are now joining forces to overthrow the international order, and their main enemies are the United States and the European Union.\nWeng Mingxian said that there is another influencing factor in the so-called century-old changes, that is, the US presidential election will be held on November 5. If Biden is elected, it will continue to create a tense situation in which the United States has to deal with the strategic alliance between China and Russia. But another variable is that if Trump is elected, with Trump\u2019s leadership style, he may put the United States first to implement global strategy, which will also pose another risk to the so-called global strategic pattern of China and Russia.\nLai Rongwei said that no matter whether Trump or Biden is president of the United States, the confrontation between Russia and NATO and the confrontation between the United States and China will continue.\nHe analyzed that because China and Russia are considered to be the evil camp, this points to confrontation with the West in terms of values. For example, the United States often names Russia and China for interfering in their elections, and Taiwan has also been talking about the CCP's cognitive warfare. Both China and Russia are using vague spaces and techniques to change the status quo, and are using the values \u200b\u200bof Western liberal democracy and the normal state of economic freedom to carry out their conspiratorial infiltration.

However, Beijing not only failed to accuse Moscow of its aggressive actions, but instead took the opportunity to strengthen political, diplomatic, and economic and trade relations with Russia, and even bought energy products that Russia was forced to sell at a discount due to Western sanctions.\nBefore launching the war in Ukraine, Putin made a special visit to Beijing and signed a series of cooperation documents with Xi Jinping known as \"unlimited\". China and Russia have obvious intentions of holding back-to-back to warm up in the face of resistance from the United States and the West.\nThe United States currently positions China as its biggest strategic competitor and views Russia as the country that poses the greatest threat.

Western diplomats and observers have long predicted that Putin would choose Beijing as the first stop of his overseas trip during his new term.\nPutin told reporters on Sunday that Russia and China have similar views on global affairs and that their relationship is highly resilient because of his close personal relationship with Xi. Putin said that Moscow and Beijing will further deepen their bilateral relations in the coming years.\nXi Jinping also visited Moscow in March last year, shortly after breaking with decades of CCP practice to seek a third term.

Although it is difficult to thaw Russia-US relations, it is possible to strengthen contacts with Europe.\"\r\n\n\r\nHao He, associate researcher at the Institute of Russian, Eastern European and Central Asian Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, believes that what Russia will do in the next 6 to 12 years will depend more on what the world will become. \"Because it is not very likely that Russia will achieve particularly great economic achievements through a radical transformation of its model, but at a time of major changes unseen in a century, changes in the world may bring some new opportunities to Russia.\"\r\n\n\nWhy did Putin focus on the \"people's livelihood card\" during the election campaign?\n\n\r\nThe Russian general election was held as scheduled against the backdrop of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.\r\n\n\r\nThis is Russia's first wartime election, and it is also the first time Russia has held presidential election voting in the four \"new regions\" of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporozhie and Kherson. All four regions are currently in a state of war. Prior to this, Ukraine declared wartime cancellation of presidential elections.\r\n\n\n\n\n\nOn March 17, local time, people in the Luhansk region participated in voting in the Russian presidential election.", "uid": "03_00_83", "input": "Putin delivering a speech."}

On the other hand, it is also closely related to high inflation and increasingly higher benchmark interest rates.\nAccording to data released by the Russian State Statistics Service in January this year, Russia\u2019s inflation rate in 2023 will be 7.42%. In order to curb inflation, the Central Bank of Russia has raised its benchmark interest rate several times since July 2023. On February 16 this year, the Russian Central Bank announced that it would keep the benchmark interest rate unchanged at 16%. As home loan interest rates rise, more and more Russians are turning their attention to the rental market, further boosting demand for rental housing. With supply exceeding demand and rising prices, many landlords have chosen to raise rents.\nThis trend is still continuing. Taking the capital Moscow as an example, data provided by Yandex Rent shows that in January this year, the average rent of a one-bedroom apartment in Moscow rose to 55,000 rubles (approximately RMB 4,389), and the average rent of a two-bedroom apartment reached 80,000 rubles (approximately RMB 4,389).

In 2023, Russia will have more than 110 million square meters of new housing area. In the future, Russia will continue to increase investment and provide preferential mortgage loan policies to make housing affordable for ordinary families, especially to reduce the housing pressure on families with many children.\nBefore starting his own small family, Dmitry once shared a three-bedroom apartment with two of his friends in order to save rent. After having his own children, Dmitry took out a loan to buy a property of his own, relying on the above-average salary brought by his job as a programmer and the subsidies provided by \"Mother Capital\".\nNow, Dmitry no longer has to worry about housing. For him, perhaps the biggest worry is the uncertainty of when the war will end. Although he lives near Moscow, far away from the front line, he has heard news more than once that a drone was shot down nearby. He had also felt fear when he heard that Prigozhin and Wagner's soldiers were marching towards Moscow.\nRegarding politics, Dmitri did not like to discuss too much. He admitted that he was not a fan of Putin, but now he had no choice. At the same time, he also has no good opinion of Western countries that provide Ukraine with large amounts of weapons. The only thing Dmitry is sure of is that his country is fighting a war it cannot lose.\n\"I have a complicated attitude towards the war.
