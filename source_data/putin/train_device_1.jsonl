He considered a change of power crucial to Russia's dynamics, but also said that if the amendments are approved by the Constitutional Court, the former head of state should be able to run for office in a new presidential election under the updated constitution. Regarding this idea, Putin emphasized that in the upcoming referendum on April 22, \"only if citizens support such a proposal\" can such a proposal become a reality.\nPutin also said: \"Since the initiative to amend the constitution comes from me, I would like to express my position here. The constitutional amendment has long been mature, and I firmly believe that the amendment will be useful to our citizens, it will strengthen our sovereignty, our traditions and Our values.\" He said he hopes to work together with members of the State Duma to work for the country until 2024, \"and we will see how things develop then.\"\nAccording to previous reports by Russian media, if the second reading goes well, the Russian State Duma will conduct a third reading of the draft constitutional amendment at 10:00 Moscow time on March 11. It will then be voted upon by the Federation Council, followed by approval by two-thirds of the legislative assemblies (local assemblies) of the subjects of the Russian Federation, and then reviewed by the Constitutional Court for specific provisions, and finally submitted to a referendum.\nThe referendum is scheduled for April 22. If more than half of the citizens who vote support it, the constitutional amendment will take effect on the day the voting results are announced.\nPutin proposed amending the constitution when delivering a State of the Union address to both houses of the Russian Parliament on January 15, and a constitutional amendment working group was formed on the same day.

Another video shows a young woman stuffing ballots while observers are distracted.\n\nWhile Russian citizens were voting, the main question was: what will the turnout be?\n\nKremlin officials were clearly focused on achieving huge results for Putin to demonstrate his legitimacy, and by mid-afternoon, hours before polls closed, election officials were projecting turnout to be as high as 70 percent.\n\nKremlin insiders said before voting day that the desired outcome would be a \u201c70-70\u201d result: 70 percent of the vote for Putin with a 70 percent turnout.\n\nOn Sunday evening, the Central Election Commission announced that more than half of Russia's adult population had already voted, and turnout exceeded that of the previous elections, which took place in 2012.\n\nSome analysts believe the March 4 nerve agent poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal, which British authorities blame on Russia, was planned to provoke a confrontation with the West to boost turnout and support for Putin on a patriotic wave.\n\nThis suggestion was categorically rejected on the eve of the election by Putin's aides, who said Russia was not involved in the poisoning. Some officials claim that the incident was staged by British authorities.\n\nThe deterioration of British-Russian relations has given some voters pause. At a polling station in Moscow school No. 1250, businessman Alexey said: \u201cI think all these allegations were concocted by the British government. I don't think anyone poisoned Skripal. Our country did not poison anyone.\u201d\n\nPolice officers roamed across the street from the school, ready to respond to protests that had been talked about but never materialized.\n\nMost Muscovites interviewed by the Voice of America correspondent said that Putin is the ideal candidate. Some voters explained that they support him because he has restored Russia's power and transformed the country from a regional power to a global one.\n\nBefore the vote, Putin emphasized the restoration of Russian power. This was especially noticeable in his message to the Federal Assembly, in which he stated that the world was now forced to listen to Russia.\n", "uid": "00_08_77", "input": "Preliminary rigged election results showing Vladimir Putin receiving approximately 87% of the vote.\nSecuring a fifth term in office by cheating.\nEncouraging participation in rigged elections.\nRussia's illegal annexation of Crimea.\nAnti-war candidates barred from running in Russian elections.\nPreventing political opponents from running in elections.\nThrowing substances into ballot boxes during elections.\nThe nerve agent poisoning of individuals allegedly linked to Russia.\nStaging protests during the Russian election.\nInterviewing individuals for media coverage.\nRestoration of state control and power in Russia under Putin.\nTransforming a country's economy."}

Although he did not personally experience the cruelty of the war, the two-year war still left a deep mark on his heart. Around him, there were people who were fighting on the front line, facing blood and death, and there were also people whose lives were stuck at the age of 25 forever under bullets. \"Terror\" and \"terrible\" are the adjectives he most often uses when talking about war.\nOn one side is the war with no end in sight, on the other side is life that must go on. How to continue to explore one's own life in a fragmented reality is a question that young Andrei and many ordinary Russians must face.\nFor the future, Andrei has simple and slightly naive expectations: \"I hope everyone can live in peace. I hope Ukrainians will come to Russia and drink our red cabbage soup, and we can also go to Ukraine and drink theirs.\" Beetroot soup. I want American burgers on our table and our pancakes on their table, honestly, I don\u2019t want to find out who\u2019s right and who\u2019s wrong, I just want this to end.\u201d\nWhen Andre talks about the war, the first thing he thinks of is his friend Sasha, who is currently fighting on the front line. \"Almost every Russian today knows someone on the front line,\" Andrei said. \"Sasha is a childhood friend of mine who has been fighting on the front line since the beginning of the conflict. We haven't been in touch for a long time... I Hope he survives.\"\nIn September 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a partial mobilization order, announcing that 300,000 reservists would be recruited. This is the first time Russia has launched military mobilization since World War II. Putin said at the time that \"first of all, those who have served in the armed forces and have certain military expertise and relevant experience will be called up for military service.\" \"Those who are called up for military service must receive additional military training before being deployed to the troops. \".\nUnlike the Russian people who were conscripted during the war, Andrei's friend Sasha had already voluntarily joined the army before the outbreak of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict and became a contract soldier. Before joining the army, Sasha was just an ordinary construction worker and had a younger sister at home. At that time, for those who did not receive higher education and were in good physical condition, joining the army was a good option to obtain a higher salary. There are also some highly educated people who choose to join the military, where they receive higher wages and different responsibilities than others.\n\"Before February 2022, being a contract soldier is not that scary. They don't need to fight at that time, and the army's salary for contract soldiers has always been very high.\" Andre said.\nAndre also added that during the war, contract soldiers were paid higher, with a minimum monthly salary of around US$2,000 (approximately RMB 14,000), and some even received US$3,000-5,000 (approximately RMB 22,000- 36,000 yuan).

Visual China Map\n\nThe Russian presidential election ended without any surprises. Putin was successfully re-elected. For the EU, this is a result that everyone has expected. Countries have probably already prepared corresponding rhetoric. On the evening of March 17, EU countries had begun negotiations on the wording of the joint communiqu\u00e9. On March 18, the foreign ministers of the European Union gathered in Brussels. Among them, the foreign ministers of the Eastern European countries were as sharp as ever in their evaluation of the Russian election. The Lithuanian Foreign Minister was the first foreign minister to be interviewed by reporters that day. When the reporter mentioned his views on Putin's successful re-election, his first reaction was: \"Your wording is really tolerant and generous.\" He then said that the EU Countries will naturally issue a joint statement on the Russian election, but the top priority right now is to continue to discuss how to support Ukraine.\nPutin's increasingly solid power is a consensus among EU countries regarding this election - Russia is unlikely to change direction in the short term. Under such circumstances, and against the background of the protracted conflict between Russia and Ukraine, it is not surprising that French President Macron said some time ago that he would not rule out sending French soldiers to Ukraine.

At that time, Artem Zoga, chairman of the People's Committee of the \"Donetsk People's Republic\", talked with Putin after the ceremony and said that the entire Donbas region hopes that Putin will participate in the election. Putin responded: \"I had different ideas at different times, but now the moment has come when I have to make a decision. I will run for president of Russia.\"\nIn this Russian election, Putin is the only presidential candidate running as an independent candidate. Some analysts believe that Putin has run as an independent candidate in three of his four elections. This approach will help him shape his image as a representative of all Russia, rather than just representing a certain party.\nAs in previous elections, Putin will not participate in pre-election debates on television and radio programs. Russian Presidential Press Secretary Peskov said that Putin is the current head of state and has a very busy schedule, which makes him fundamentally different from other candidates. The president himself appears in the media every day, and Russians have a daily opportunity to see what Putin has to say about all aspects of life.\nAlthough he did not participate in the pre-election debates, Putin frequently appeared in various domestic activities before the Russian election. After announcing his candidacy, at the end of 2023, Putin held his first \"live connection\" event and annual press conference since the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. In more than 4 hours, he answered about 80 questions from the Russian people and domestic and foreign reporters. The content covered is very wide. At the event, Putin pointed out that the Russian economy had recovered from the downward trend, emphasized that the goals of Russia's \"special military operations\" had not changed, and also mentioned the need for Russia to return to traditional values.\nAfter entering 2024, Putin\u2019s domestic itinerary is relatively intensive. From the Chukotka Autonomous Region in Russia\u2019s Far East, which he has never visited before, to the enclave of Kaliningrad in western Russia, Putin talked about the regional economy during his visits to many places.

Such a large-scale war economic expansion naturally involves rural areas. Starting from the end of 2022, people in Village A have been leaving their homes to become workers in military production, or to join construction teams in newly occupied areas.\nBut the so-called \"economic overheating\" of Russia due to the war seems to be more of a joke in a difficult situation, a blessing in misfortune. At least in major Russian cities, the impact of sanctions imposed by the West is obvious. Foreign brands have left one after another, and cross-border financial transactions of companies and individuals have been severely affected. Among ordinary people, Nikita's former colleagues were among the most affected.\nWestern sanctions since 2022 have mainly targeted the Russian middle class or wealthier people, aiming to divide the cohesion between the Russian elite and the wealthy middle class. For example, middle- and high-income people are prohibited from traveling to Europe and the United States. It is common for international students going to Europe and the United States to be deported and have their studies interrupted. Young Russians who originally wanted to study in the West have lost their qualifications to apply this year.\nHowever, in places like Village A, this rather strong measure seems to have had some counter-effects:\n\"Now those rich people in Moscow can't just take their families and children abroad!\" \"Yeah, what's so bad about Russia that they have to go to the enemy?\" \"Isn't going to Paris and London a holiday shopping trip? To support the enemy?\" These are comments that can often be heard on the streets.\nNikita found that she could not use the experience of her previous circle to try to gain the understanding of her new neighbors. And as time went by, he also believed that, aside from the jingoism and nationalism mixed in these comments, the neighbors\u2019 views were not entirely unfounded.\n\"Actually, I have to admit that the so-called urban elites were very out of place before the war. They, no, it was us,\" Nikita let out a shy laugh and hastily changed the subject, \"Always buy Western brands, go When we go on vacation in the West, use Western websites, and interact with Westerners, we seem to have forgotten that there is still a countryside in Russia. But now, it seems that everyone is brought together again, using the same brand of products, watching the same TV programs, and in the same land. \"Business and rest. In other words, in the eyes of the villagers, the war finally made Russia more like Russia.\"\nrussian fortress\nIt is somewhat absurd and ironic that a war has such unexpected effects, and strategic analysts on both sides of the war may be surprised by this.

In Russia, where there is a strong demand for military equipment but a shortage of manpower, and there is an urgent need to improve corporate production efficiency, technical talents like Yuri are obviously very \"sought-after.\" Just recently, another steel plant invited him to join a new team with a higher salary than Yuri's current salary.\nYuri said he is still considering whether to accept the new company's offer. \"Although the salary is not much higher, employees are allowed to work remotely from home. This is a good choice because the recent attacks on military factories in Ukraine have made me increasingly worried about my safety.\"\nYuri's worries were not groundless. After the conflict between Russia and Ukraine broke out, in addition to fighting on the front line, the two sides also used drones, missiles, etc. to attack each other's military industrial facilities. In recent months, Ukraine has launched increasingly frequent drone attacks against Russian military and industrial targets. On the second anniversary of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, a steel plant owned by the Novolipetsk Metallurgical Company, which accounts for about 18% of Russia's steel output, was attacked by Ukrainian drones at night, and a fire broke out in the plant.\nYuri said that steel plants around the area where he lived had been targeted, but the attack was unsuccessful. Now, explosion-proof bunkers have been set up near the company where Yuri works. However, due to the rush, the construction period of the bunkers was very short, which also made Yuri skeptical about the effectiveness of these facilities.\nAlthough the war made Yuri's work closely related to the military industry, Yuri himself could not hide his anger and sadness when talking about the war. As chief engineer, Yuri's salary has never been low. But he admitted that many people around him are increasingly inclined to buy cheap and low-quality goods, including clothes, cars and other things. \"The war is costing money and it makes no sense. Prices are getting higher and higher.\"\nWhat makes Yuri even more sad is that he has some relatives and friends in Ukraine. But now it has become very difficult for him to communicate with these relatives and friends.\n\"Before the war started, Russians and Ukrainians on the border got along very well. Before, I didn't need a visa when I went to Ukraine, and our two peoples were deeply intertwined... Now, in many families, the strongest ties Already cut off. I can\u2019t find words to describe this nightmare day after day,\u201d Yuri said painfully.\nWhat worries Yuri the most are the children who chose to leave Russia under the war. Yuri\u2019s son-in-law once worked for the social platform Instagram, but Instagram was banned in Russia shortly after the conflict between Russia and Ukraine broke out. Because their work was affected and they were worried about being mobilized to the front line, Yuri's daughter and her family chose to leave their homeland. Yuri's son and nephew faced a similar dilemma. Currently, they all live in Armenia.\nAlthough Yuri's children have now found new jobs and started a new life in Armenia, he still looks forward to family reunion. \"We don't want to raise our future grandchildren in this atmosphere, but we still hope that the children will come back after the war is over.

Despite all the violations and scandals, the election results are unlikely to be revised or disputed. The scale of Putin\u2019s victory is too great and his position in power is too strong. The opposition and Western countries can criticize the voting results as much as they want, but they cannot change them.\n\n2. At the same time, such a high result for Putin and voter turnout may have the opposite effect. Part of society will perceive these figures as unrealistic and falsified, which will undermine confidence in the authorities and election procedures as such. And this, in turn, is fraught with an increase in protest sentiments and political apathy.\n\n3. It will be interesting to see how Russia's relations with the West will develop after these elections. It is unlikely that we should expect a warming up and the lifting of sanctions; rather, on the contrary, confrontation may intensify. Much will depend on the actions of Putin himself and his willingness to compromise on key issues - from Ukraine to human rights.\n\n4. The factor of new regions - the DPR, LPR, Kherson and Zaporozhye regions - deserves special mention. Their participation in the elections and almost one hundred percent support for Putin added legitimacy to him within the country, but caused sharp rejection in the West. Now these territories will become another bone of contention between Russia and the international community.\n\n5. Finally, the question remains open about the future of Putin himself and the Russian political system. During his new term, will the current president be able to prepare a successor and ensure the transition of power? Or will he remain at the helm after 2030, under a redrawn Constitution that would allow him another run?

Regarding the West, Putin emphasized that Russia's strategic weapons are \"in a state of complete readiness.\" In his speech involving domestic issues, Putin mentioned issues such as economy, technology, and infrastructure construction.

He is significantly ahead of other candidates and has actually won the presidential election.\nAnalysts believe that after Putin's re-election, Russia's domestic and foreign affairs will continue its existing policies, including focusing on strengthening technological independence, promoting economic diversification, actively developing relations with friendly countries in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America, and promoting the development of a multi-polar world. .\n\nwin\nThe official voting for Russia's eighth presidential election was held from the 15th to the 17th.

The Russian Central Election Commission will confirm the results of the presidential election no later than March 28 and announce them within three days after the election results are confirmed.\nIn the early morning of the 18th, Putin delivered a speech at the campaign headquarters and thanked all voters for their support. He said that Russia will move forward further and become more solid, stronger and more efficient.\n\nTechnological independence and economic diversification\nAfter the Russian economy suffered shocks in the early stages of the escalation of the Ukraine crisis, it has gradually shown resilience. Data released by the Russian Federal State Statistics Service in early February this year show that Russia\u2019s GDP will grow by 3.6% in 2023. However, Western countries' blockade of Russia in the fields of finance, investment, and technological product imports has brought difficulties to the long-term development of the Russian economy. How to continue to hedge against the impact of Western sanctions is a task for Putin's administration.\nIn his State of the Union address delivered to both houses of parliament at the end of February, Putin stated that factors such as a lack of talent and insufficient own-owned advanced technology may lead to a slowdown in economic growth. Therefore, the country will vigorously strengthen the development of education, science and technology and other fields, and let technological independence become the driving force for industrial upgrading to improve the efficiency and competitiveness of the Russian economy.\nHe proposed that by 2030, the share of Russia's high-tech products and services in the domestic market should increase by 50%, and the export of non-raw materials and non-energy products should increase by at least two-thirds. Russia should possess key technologies in fields involving citizens' health and food security, and achieve technological independence in fields that can promote sustainable economic development, such as machine tools, robots, transportation, unmanned driving, aviation, oceans, digital economy, new materials and chemistry. , investment in key areas should increase by 70%, and at least 100 more science and technology parks should be built.\nPutin said that the current non-resource industries account for more than 90% of Russia's economic growth structure, and the Russian economy is becoming more diversified and sustainable.\nAksakov, chairman of the Financial Markets Committee of the Russian State Duma (lower house of parliament), said that the Russian economy is gradually adapting to Western sanctions and is changing rapidly. Western oppression has prompted Russia to vigorously promote the internal restructuring of its economy and speed up its transition away from resource dependence.\n\ncontinuation of foreign policy\nRussian experts believe that resisting Western containment and suppression, uniting friendly countries, and achieving established diplomatic goals will become the focus of Putin's future foreign policy.\nPutin has said that no matter who wins the U.S. presidential election in 2024, the U.S. foreign policy toward Russia is unlikely to undergo fundamental changes, and the U.S. will still regard Russia as its enemy.\nMukhin, director of the Russian Political Information Center, said that Putin will continue to take a tough stance against unfriendly countries. Kortunov, an expert at the Russian Council for International Affairs, said that in the coming period, Russia and the United States will continue to have in-depth confrontation, but both sides will still maintain a certain degree of restraint to avoid accidents such as nuclear war.\nRussian experts believe that Putin will continue his previous foreign policy, actively develop relations with friendly countries in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America, expand his circle of friends, strengthen his influence in international and regional organizations, and promote world multipolarity.\nIn addition, some analysts believe that Putin will pay more attention to the relationship between Russia and other BRICS countries in the future and expand this relationship to multiple areas including trade.

The shocking thing was that on October 23, 2002, a hostage incident occurred in a Moscow theater, resulting in the death of 129 hostages. , On September 1, 2004, Chechen separatist militants caused a hostage incident at the No. 1 Middle School in Beslan City, North Ossetia Republic in southern Russia, resulting in the death of 333 hostages.\n\nThe terrorist incidents spreading in Russia have killed humanity and caused the general public to live in extreme terror, causing the Russian nation's spirit to collapse and shocking the world. Russian media once said that Russia at that time was more terrifying than the dark Middle Ages.\n\nThe root cause of the terrorist incident is Chechen separatists. With extraordinary determination, Putin struck hard and ordered the 100,000-strong army to use new weapons and equipment. Over a period of three years, he used air strikes and ground sweeps to get rid of the \"nests\" of the separatist forces, and then turned to eradicating the fleeing forces. Terrorists everywhere.

Moscow quickly responded and named Merkel, who has served as German Chancellor for four consecutive times and has been at the helm of Germany for 16 years.\r\n\n\r\nAccording to a report by \"Russia Today\" on March 18, a spokesperson for the Russian Foreign Ministry said that a series of NATO actions against Russia will only help Putin win a fifth term. Zakharova said that by consolidating NATO's image as a \"dangerous enemy\" in the minds of Russians, the West precisely ensured Putin's historic victory in the presidential election.\r\n\n\r\nAccording to Russian media, the German Foreign Ministry said that the Russian presidential election was \"neither free nor fair\" and that \"the results were not surprising.\" The White House echoed this statement last Sunday. British Defense Secretary Shapps accused Putin of \"stealing the election again\" but \"cannot steal Ukraine.\"\u200b\r\n\n\r\nAccording to data released by the Russian Central Election Commission on the 18th, with all votes counted, current President Putin received 87.28% of the vote, overwhelmingly winning his fifth term. The \"Russia Today\" website also pointed out that the turnout rate in this year's election was as high as 74%, which not only exceeded the 67.47% in the 2018 election, but also set a record high. The \"Donetsk People's Republic\", the \"Luhansk People's Republic\" and the Kherson and Zaporizhia regions participated in the elections for the first time.\r\n\n\n\n\n\nOn March 18, local time, in Moscow, a large-scale music rally was held in Red Square to commemorate the tenth anniversary of Crimea's \"entry into Russia\". Russian President Vladimir Putin and three presidential candidates Slutsky, Kharitonov and Davankov attended. Image from IC Photo\n\n\r\nAs Putin sealed the victory in advance, Zakharova refuted Western accusations on the social media platform Telegram on the 17th, saying that Western countries just cannot tolerate Russia's show of unity, especially Germany. She also reminded the West that Merkel had been elected German Prime Minister four times in a row, and her predecessor Helmut Kohl had been in power for 16 consecutive years.\r\n\n\r\n\"Germans themselves are wondering whether this fits with the German understanding of democracy... For some reason no one talks about a lack of freedom or injustice,\" she wrote.\r\n\n\r\nZakharova said that regarding the Russian elections, the only consensus she has with Germany is that the results are \"unsurprising\": \"NATO barks at our country several times a day, threatening us and causing conflicts on our borders... It\u2019s no surprise that the whole country (Russia) unites to fight back!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIn another post, she went on to refute the British defense secretary's claims that Putin \"stole\" the election: \"We didn't steal anything from them and we didn't give them anything. So they're angry.\"\r\n\n\r\nOn the evening of March 17, local time, the voting for the Russian presidential election ended. Putin delivered a speech at the campaign headquarters and answered questions from reporters on special military operations, the possibility of negotiations with Ukraine, relations with the United States, and relations with NATO.\r\n\n\r\nPutin warned the West that day that a direct conflict between Russia and the U.S.-led NATO meant that the earth was \"only one step away\" from World War III. He first joked lightly that \"everything is possible in the modern world,\" and then He also responded seriously that \"almost no one wants this to happen.\" He also revealed that NATO military personnel are actually present in Ukraine, so Russian soldiers have learned to speak English and French on the battlefield.\r\n\n\r\nPutin refuted criticisms from the United States and Western countries that the Russian election was \"unfree\" and \"unfair.\" He said that U.S. elections are truly \"undemocratic\" and some people even use the country's public power to deal with former President Trump. \"The whole world is laughing at what happened there.

At the beginning of his term, Putin's approval rating experienced a rare decline due to the Russian government's implementation of a delayed retirement policy. \"Pain points\" such as eradicating poverty, achieving net population growth, and boosting Russia's economic development have also appeared in Putin's State of the Union address for many years. In addition to people's livelihood issues, the relationship between Russia and the West has continued its previous deterioration. After Russia launched a \"special military operation\" in February 2022, Western countries imposed unprecedented all-round sanctions on Russia. The political, economic and trade, cultural exchanges and arms control systems of both parties were severely impacted.\nTwo years after the war was postponed, the Russian economy has shown some resilience. After experiencing a 2.1% contraction in 2022, the Russian economy will achieve 3.6% growth in 2023. Some analysts believe that record-high defense spending and a strong military industry are the main driving forces behind the Russian economy's ability to maintain growth under Western sanctions. At the same time, Russia's long-term gradual de-dollarization and \"turn east\" and \"turn south\" strategies have also helped it offset the adverse effects of Western financial and energy sanctions to a certain extent. However, in the face of high inflation, labor shortages and the adverse effects of long-term sanctions, the sustainability of Russia's wartime economy remains to be seen.\nRegarding Russia's development path in the next six years, Putin gave a detailed outlook in his State of the Union address in February this year. In his longest State of the Union address to date, Putin mentioned that Russia\u2019s current task is to develop the defense industry and thereby increase the country\u2019s scientific, technological and industrial potential. It must allocate resources as rationally as possible and establish an effective wartime economic system. . While accelerating the solution of Russia's social, demographic, infrastructure and other problems, we must also raise the equipment of the army and navy to a new level. According to the Russian federal budget plan, Russian military spending will exceed social spending for the first time in 2024.\nFor Putin, who is entering his fifth term, the next six years will still be difficult to say easy. The dawn of peace talks between Russia and Ukraine has not yet appeared, the confrontation between Russia and the West has intensified, and the risk of conflict expansion still exists.

A new geopolitical balance of power, with Russia\u2019s growing presence and influence.\u201d\nAlthough Putin's electoral victory is no longer in doubt, whether he can maintain his iron grip on power, especially his eventual victory on the Ukraine issue, is far from a sure thing. He experienced a clear miscalculation when his government's \"Special Military Operation\" in Ukraine did not succeed as quickly as expected, as well as the mercenary Wagner Group leader Yevgeny Prigozhin It launched an insurgency and suffered successive battlefield defeats, while Western sanctions cut off much of the Russian economy from global markets.\nImportantly, the U.S. presidential election in November is likely to change the situation in the Russia-Ukraine war. Whether Putin can get out of the predicament is difficult to predict. U.S. President Joe Biden has yet to comment on Putin's victory.\n(This article refers to reports from Reuters)\nEditor in charge: Li Lin#", "uid": "03_00_58", "input": ""}

The outside world is paying attention to how Putin will lead Russia to meet the \"hard core\" challenge.\nTake orders in times of danger\nIn 2023, the All-Russian Public Opinion Research Center conducted a survey among Russians over the age of 18. The most common comments given by respondents to Putin's image and political achievements were: calm, energetic, decisive and wise. Nearly three-quarters of the respondents believe that Putin has the ability to ensure Russia's stability and development.\nThese characteristics were gradually revealed when Putin entered the political arena.\nThe \"shock therapy\" and economic crisis in the 1990s caused the Russian economy to hit rock bottom and social problems became prominent. Putin wrote in the article \"Russia at the Turn of the Millennium\" that \"Russia's gross domestic product (GDP) has dropped by almost 50%...Russia is in one of the most difficult historical periods in hundreds of years. This is probably Russia's last two years. For the first time in three hundred years, it was truly in danger of becoming a second- or third-rate country in the world.\u201d He realized that stabilizing and developing the economy was the \u201ctop priority\u201d at that time.\nAfter taking over the Kremlin in 2000, Putin adjusted economic policies and carried out tax reforms on the one hand; on the other hand, he began to reveal his \"strongman\" style, vigorously combating oligarchy and restoring the country's control over the economic lifeline.\n\nFile photo: The Kremlin in central Moscow. Photo by Tian Bing issued by China News Service\nDuring this period, which coincided with the rise in international oil prices and a relatively stable political and economic environment, Russia seized the opportunity and developed rapidly. In the first eight years of the 21st century, Russia's GDP grew by about 70% and its industry grew by 75%; in 2005, Russia ranked among the top ten economies in the world.\nWith the improvement of economic strength, Russia's international influence has gradually increased. The 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics and the 2018 World Cup were held in Russia.\nOver the years, Russia's poverty problem has improved. From 2000 to 2023, the number of poor people decreased from at least 42 million to 13.5 million. Putin also proposed that Russia\u2019s poverty level should be further reduced to below 7% by 2030.\n\"Putin's political achievements have brought tangible benefits to the Russian people and have won their love and support.\" Chen Yurong, a researcher at the China Institute of International Studies, told China News Service.\nMany tests\nAfter the Ukrainian crisis escalated in 2022, Russia was subject to more than 10,000 Western sanctions, and a large number of Western companies withdrew from the Russian market. Subsequently, Putin signed an order to switch to using rubles to settle natural gas bills with \"unfriendly countries\".

Published by Xinhua News Agency (Photo by Alexander)\n In the 1990s, when Russia became an independent country, the political situation was ups and downs and continued to be unstable. \"Shock therapy\" led to a severe economic recession, soaring prices, and poor people's livelihood. Putin once worriedly believed that Russia was in danger of becoming a second- or even third-rate country in the world.\n Since taking over the Kremlin in 2000, Putin has vigorously cracked down on the oligarchy and restored the country's control over the economic lifeline. At the same time, he actively adjusted economic policies, promoted structural reforms, and combated the shadow economy. At the beginning of the 21st century, Russia took advantage of the rising international oil prices to step out of its predicament and achieve rapid economic development. As its economic strength increases, Russia's international influence gradually increases.\n When the Ukraine crisis broke out in 2014, facing the threat of Western sanctions, Russia began to make long-term plans, implement an import substitution strategy, strive to get rid of its dependence on energy exports, strengthen financial security construction, and continue to promote economic de-dollarization. Russia withstood the comprehensive sanctions initiated by the West in early 2022 and began to achieve economic growth in the second half of 2022.\n Russian political scientist Oleg Matvechev said that it is under Putin's leadership that Russia has resolved one crisis after another.\n Moscow citizen Irina said she was proud of the country and President Putin. It was Putin who made Russia a country that would not be bullied at will. The West always attempts to use various means such as economic sanctions to isolate Russia, but their plots have not succeeded.\n Fighting Western Suppression\n Shortly before the start of voting in this Russian presidential election, Sweden became the 32nd member of NATO, completing a new round of expansion of NATO. At the same time, the United States and the West continue to \"add fuel to the fire\" to the Ukraine crisis, and the geopolitical game between Russia and the West is intensifying.\n\n On March 11, Swedish Prime Minister Kristersson (left) and NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg attended a joint press conference at the NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium. NATO held a ceremony for Sweden to join NATO at its headquarters on the same day. Sweden becomes the 32nd member of NATO. Photo by Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhao Dingzhe\n Putin has stated on many occasions on different occasions that he will never sit idly by and ignore NATO's provocations, and emphasized his determination to safeguard the country's territorial sovereignty. His warning was straightforward, highlighting Russia's uncompromising bottom line on national security issues.\n When Putin delivered his State of the Union address this year, he said that the West had failed in its attempts to plunge Russia into strife and civil strife. Russia does not allow anyone to interfere in Russia's internal affairs, and any armed intervention will suffer an unprecedented defeat.\n Russian political scientist Sergei Markov said that people support Putin because Putin is a symbol of sovereignty and independence in the face of Western pressure on Russia. People realize that Putin has the ability to lead Russia to fight back against U.S. hegemony and safeguard national interests.\n Russian voter Vycheslav said that Russians regard Putin as a leader who fights against U.S. hegemony and are willing to work with Putin to oppose NATO's eastward expansion and defend national security.", "uid": "03_00_11", "input": "Restoration of state control and power in Russia under Putin.\nPutin's adjustment of economic policies and tax reforms.\nPromotion of national development by Vladimir Putin.\nThe Ukraine crisis involving Russia and Western sanctions.\nThe outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.\nRussia withstood Western sanctions.\nRussia's economic growth.\nPutin's role as Russia's crisis manager.\nAttempts to suppress the will of Russians.\nNATO's eastward expansion and its geopolitical consequences.\nJoining new political or social entities.\nWestern attempts to create provocations.\nPutin's declaration to advance deeper into Ukraine and issue new threats against the West.\nRussian authorities' warnings against demonstrations and unsanctioned activities.\nPutin delivering a speech.\nAttempts to interfere in Russia's elections.\nWestern pressure on Russia."}

Also congratulating the Russian President on his re-election were Venezuelan President Maduro, as well as the national leaders of Nicaragua and Tajikistan.\nAccording to exit polls, Putin received nearly 88% of the vote. After the results came out, Putin held a press conference in Moscow to thank the Russian people for their support and once again threatened NATO with a \"world war.\"\nWhen asked by reporters about the risks and possibilities of conflict between Russia and NATO, Putin responded that \"everything is possible in the modern world.\" He said: \"Everyone knows that (if there is a conflict between NATO and Russia), it is only one step away from World War III. I don't think anyone wants to see this situation.\"\nPutin also said that Moscow knew that NATO troops were deployed in Ukraine. But he did not provide clear evidence, only saying that the Russian army heard people speaking English and French on the battlefield.\nWestern countries have accused Russia of lacking free and fair presidential elections.

Moreover, the Sino-Russian alliance is still based on their respective interests and is not \"confidest friends\".\nHe said: \"Although Putin expressed his stance on the situation in the Taiwan Strait and even emphasized that Taiwan is part of China, the most important thing is to express diplomatic support for China and then to improve relations with China.

People who were forced to come to polling stations and vote involuntarily, as well as members of the commission who rewrote protocols in violation of the law, understand perfectly well the real cost of such elections. Just like the presidential administration, which had a hand in all this.\u201d\n\nBut the current owner of the Kremlin is probably pleased - at least he obviously believes that everything is in his power, everyone can be forced to dance to his tune and even pretend that they believe in the interest rates presented, David Kankia summarized.\n\nAs a result of the presidential campaign, the Russian authorities achieved everything they wanted, says political scientist Fyodor Krasheninnikov. In his opinion, they are not at all confused by the methods by which the desired results were obtained.\n\n\u201cNow they will interpret any nuance in their favor,\u201d he added in a comment to Voice of America. \u2013 For example, there are no elections in Ukraine, but they took place in Russia. Therefore, the Kremlin will say that Putin is legitimate, but Zelensky is not. In addition, there are doubts about the election results outside, not inside Russia. Inside, any \u201csedition\u201d is mercilessly suppressed. But the authorities and propaganda will tirelessly repeat that Putin was legitimately elected, and with an overwhelming advantage.\u201d\n\nThe excessively high percentage for Putin is explained by the fact that the Kremlin is convinced that during a war, the entire people should unite around the leader, believes Fyodor Krasheninnikov: \u201cAlthough it is clear that the record result was achieved solely due to unprecedented falsifications. Not only is electronic voting an uncontrollable abyss, but it has also been revealed that tens of millions of people, many of whom most likely do not exist at all, or those who simply did not go to the polls, nevertheless \u201cexpressed their will\u201d as they should. The same applies to voting in the occupied Ukrainian territories. Everyone there was en masse enrolling as voters. Thus, it is generally impossible to analyze these elections taking into account the huge number of attributions and other frauds.\u201d\n\nOf course, many people voted for Putin, but, of course, not in such absurd numbers, the political scientist concluded.\n\nVladimir Putin's inauguration is scheduled for May 7 this year.

In Rostov-on-Don, life remains peaceful most of the time. Faced with rising prices, while people are working harder to maintain their lives, they are also looking forward to peace coming as soon as possible and life to return to what it was before. Military mobilization was once people's greatest fear. But as the conflict continues and the situation becomes clearer, this concern is no longer as strong as before.\nFor Andre personally, the war did not have a very profound impact on his life. He only vaguely remembered that a drone was shot down in the city where he lived last year. If there was anything that briefly broke the tranquility of his life in the past two years, it was probably the \"rebellion\" launched by Prigozhin in June 2023.\nAt that time, the Prigozhin and Wagner soldiers who rose up from Rostov-on-Don were supported by many people here. Two months later, Prigozhin and many senior Wagner officials died in a plane crash.\nFaced with a situation that he was unable to change, Andre turned his attention away from politics and focused on his own life. He summed up his attitude towards the war with this sentence: \"Honestly, I don't want to find out who is right and who is wrong, I just want it to end.\"\nCurrently, he is working in a furniture company. In addition to his daily work, he also spends time learning foreign languages \u200b\u200bto explore more possibilities for himself. From time to time, he earns some extra money through photography, and occasionally shoots videos and uploads them to social platforms. Andre still has his own expectations for the future.\n\"If there used to be many foreign products in the Russian market, now there are fewer, and many new opportunities have emerged. This will give you the motivation to build your own brand and business. For example, the Russian version of YouTube, the Russian version of Spotify. I I\u2019m making videos now, but it\u2019s just a hobby, and I don\u2019t have many fans.

Since the war has greatly promoted the development of Russian military industrial enterprises, Yuri, who is 56 years old this year, has just received a new job offer.\nYuri is currently the chief engineer of a Russian company on the Russian-Ukrainian border. His work belongs to the initial stage of steel manufacturing, that is, the ore mining and beneficiation process. Before the war, Yuri's company sold half of its steel overseas. However, after the conflict between Russia and Ukraine broke out, Western countries began to ban the purchase of steel from Russia. Now, most of these steels are bought by the Russian government and used to make military equipment, artillery shells and other war supplies.\nAfter the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, Russia significantly increased its defense spending and increased its support for military-industrial enterprises.", "uid": "03_07_76", "input": "The death of opposition leader Alexei Navalny in an Arctic prison.\nWorking.\nSelling assets.\nThe outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.\n\"Banning\".\nPerformance increase in various sectors and measures."}

The foreign ministers of the three former Soviet republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are almost all eager for the EU to send troops to Ukraine. The Foreign Minister of Latvia expressed full praise for French President Macron's recent speech, and it feels like Western Europe has finally woken up.\nAt a press conference after the election vote on the 17th, Putin responded for the first time to questions about the death of the famous Russian opposition leader Navalny. This shows from the side that Putin is confident in his control of power after winning the election. This also leads to the dilemma facing the EU - facing a Russia that is unlikely to change its attitude in the short term, and a Russia that is determined to survive Ukraine until the oil is exhausted, how can the EU effectively support Kiev in the long term?\nSince the all-out war between Russia and Ukraine, the United States has been Ukraine's main arms aid provider. The negative consequences of the EU's long-term over-reliance on the United States under the NATO structure are now clearly revealed. The EU's own defense industry is not sufficient to support it alone in providing Ukraine with the weapons and ammunition that the latter needs. Without US involvement, it would be difficult for the EU to support it on its own.\nTrump successfully won the Republican presidential nomination, the current US President Biden is in an \"age crisis\", and the Republican-dominated House of Representatives has blocked military aid funding for Ukraine several times, all of which are questioning whether the United States can continue to stand firm after the year-end election. Winning this protracted war with Europe has become questionable.\nIn fact, since the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, European countries have been actively expanding their defense industries. Germany immediately announced a substantial increase in its defense budget. Poland's defense expenditure will rise to 4% of GDP in 2023, ranking first in NATO. France, the traditional military leader within the EU, is actively taking the lead in building the EU's own defense industry chain.\nBut freezing three feet doesn't last a day. Since the end of the Cold War, Europe has been at peace for a long time. With the exception of France, other NATO member states have relied heavily on the United States for weapons and equipment, and their own R&D and production capabilities have been unable to quickly build up.\nAt the same time, France and Germany also have different views on who should lead the EU defense industry. France believes that as a traditional power, it has an independent defense industry, is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, and a legal nuclear-armed country, so it should naturally take the lead. On the other hand, Germany believes that it is the main investor. At the same time, Germany is far more active than France in aiding Ukraine, and it should be led by itself.\nA good example is Macron\u2019s military theory on Ukraine. As soon as this statement came out, public opinion in France was in an uproar. On the one hand, of course, the French are unwilling to die for Ukraine. On the other hand, French media also pointed out that France\u2019s military aid to Ukraine lags far behind Germany\u2019s. Instead of attracting attention, it is better to honestly send more money first.\nAs the saying goes, it is better to listen to what someone says than to watch what someone does. Although the EU can remain firm in its policy adjustments, real money, weapons and ammunition are the real challenges that the EU will face this year and even next year.", "uid": "03_07_18", "input": "The death of opposition leader Alexei Navalny.\nExpanding cooperation and defense capabilities amidst sanctions and conflict.\nPerformance increase in various sectors and measures."}

After the end of World War II, it was once occupied by the Soviet Union. In March 1969, three bloody armed conflicts broke out between China and the Soviet Union on Zhenbao Island on the border, resulting in heavy casualties on both sides.

Defense and security spending combined are expected to account for about 40% of all budget spending. This is the first time that Russia's military spending has exceeded social spending. .\nThe substantial growth in defense spending and manufacturing related to military operations has largely played a role in promoting Russia's economic development. According to Russian official data, as of the end of 2023, Russia's GDP will increase by 3.6% compared with 2022. In addition to growing consumer demand and increasing adaptation to Western sanctions, the growth of manufacturing is also an important driver of Russia's economic growth.\nAccording to estimates by Alexander Isakov, an economist at VTB Capital, manufacturing growth will contribute 1.2 percentage points to Russia\u2019s GDP growth in 2023, and about half of this will come from companies closest to the military-industrial complex. Metal, electronic equipment and transportation manufacturing and other fields.\nAgainst this background, Russian military-industrial enterprises\u2019 demand for personnel has increased rapidly. Putin said in February this year that the Russian military-industrial complex currently includes 6,000 companies with a total of 3.5 million employees. In just one and a half years, the Russian military-industrial complex has created 520,000 new jobs.\nAccording to Yuri, since the main buyers of steel are still Western countries and military demand is relatively small, his company's overall turnover has still declined to a certain extent. However, Yuri's salary did not decrease as a result. On the contrary, his income is increasing. Yuri explained that this is inseparable from the labor shortage problem that Russia is currently facing.\nAs one of the early people affected by Russia's delayed retirement policy and a practitioner in military-related industries, 56-year-old Yuri has a deep understanding of Russia's long-term demographic crisis and the current labor shortage. He was supposed to retire at the age of 60, but now he still needs to continue working for 9 years.\nYuri mentioned that continuing to work after retirement is very common in Russia. This way people can earn more money on top of their pension. After delaying retirement, the time during which they can receive \"double salary\" is shortened.\nIn addition to the demographic crisis, Russia's labor shortage has become increasingly serious due to the impact of military mobilization after the Russian-Ukrainian conflict and a new wave of \"immigration.\" According to a latest research report released by the Russian Academy of Sciences, Russia's labor gap will reach 4.8 million people in 2023, and this problem is becoming a constraint on Russia's economic development.\n\"The shortage of labor forces employers to pay higher wages in order to retain employees.\" Yuri explained.\nAccording to relevant data on the Russian labor market, the current salary levels of mechanics, welders and other employees in Russian military factories have exceeded that of many ordinary white-collar workers. In pursuit of better treatment, personnel previously engaged in civilian production are moving to related companies in the machinery manufacturing field, including the military industry sector.

More than 80 years ago, in order to buy time to prepare for the battle to defend Moscow, which was crucial to the survival of the Soviet Union, the Red Army troops held on to Yelniya for many days at an absolute disadvantage, and suffered heavy casualties. After the fierce battle, the Red Army finally slowed down the advance of the Nazi German army. Behind rows of fallen Red Army soldiers, a defense line to defend Moscow was built.\nHowever, what happened more than 80 years ago is too far away after all, and most of the direct parties have passed away. Over the years, the town has gradually declined and become dilapidated, losing young people and its Soviet-era infrastructure has become seriously outdated. For the residents who remain there, time seems frozen.\nBut the conflict between Russia and Ukraine broke this state. After February 24, 2022, Russian media continued to enter this originally quiet town. The purpose of their reporting was clear: to focus on the glorious history of the town and to use the sacrifices of the Soviet Red Army to arouse the patriotic enthusiasm of the Russian public. As a result, the popularity of the town began to gather again, and some people even made special trips to visit the war relics.\nIn other words, the war burning in Ukraine seems to have revived the town of Yelnya, which has been dormant for decades.

Immediately afterwards, I received a polite but decisive rejection.\nThe polling place near the Belarus station was relatively lively, with people coming in and out from time to time. However, there were security guards stationed on the long road from the gate to the station entrance. They could only guard the door and occasionally catch people who had just cast their votes to ask about the situation.

However, it is generally believed that this will not affect Putin's re-election.\nPutin's most high-profile political rival was Alexei Navalny, who died in an Arctic exile last month. His supporters called on Russian voters to attend \"noon anti-Putin\" protests at polling stations on Sunday to express their dissent.\nProtesters at home and abroad went to polling stations in their regions at noon on Sunday to participate in what the opposition claimed was a \"peaceful but symbolic\" protest against Putin's re-election. The purpose of the activity is to reduce Putin's vote count. The suggested methods include casting invalid votes, spoiling their votes, or voting for one of the three other candidates besides Putin. But the opposition knows that none of the three candidates can pose any credible challenge to Putin. These three people are called \"opposition within the system\" and are just symbolic opponents. Their parties generally support the government led by Putin.\nVideos posted on YouTube by Navalny's allies showed people lining up at different polling stations across Russia at noon on Sunday. And during the midday hour in Asia and Europe, overseas protesters gathered at polling stations at Russian diplomatic missions. Navalny's widow, Yulia, showed up at the Russian embassy in Berlin for a midday protest.\nBefore his death, Navalny posted a message on social media through his lawyer, indicating his support for the \"Noontime Anti-Putin\" plan.\nRussian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova questioned whether those voting at foreign embassies were all Putin opponents and accused Western media of spreading propaganda about the events.\nShe said that these people came to vote and \"it is their free choice who to vote for and how to vote.\"\nThe Kremlin views Navalny's political allies, most of whom are outside Russia, as dangerous extremists, accusing them of destabilizing Russia on behalf of Western countries.\nBecause Russia is so vast, spanning 11 time zones, protest voters are dispersed rather than concentrated, making it difficult to estimate how many people took part in the protests.\nAlthough many people turned out for the anti-Putin midday vote, not all voters who went to the polls were opponents.\nThe three-day election is looming over the shadow of war in Ukraine: Ukraine has repeatedly attacked Russian oil refineries, shelled Russian regions and tried to breach Russia's borders with proxy forces. Putin said he would retaliate.\nPutin, who has served as Russia's president or prime minister since the end of 1999, has little doubt that he will win a new six-year term in this election.

Current President Vladimir Putin is widely expected to win re-election in the general election.\nStanislav Andreichuk, co-chairman of the election watchdog group Golos, said the use of electronic voting for the first time in a general election and the fact that voting was spread over three days made the electoral process even more opaque.\n\"This is the most closed and opaque election in Russia's history,\" Andreychuk told Reuters in an interview.\nThe Kremlin says the election, which begins on Friday, is a properly democratic process and predicts Putin will win based on overwhelming popular support.\nThe Russian election agency stated that this election will be supervised by 706 foreign observers. In addition, as many as 1/3 of the 1 million Russian observers nominated by candidates, political parties and social organizations will participate in supervision.\nAndreychuk said the high turnout on the first day of the election reflected workplace supervisors putting pressure on people to ensure they went to the polls.\nHe said: \"Everyone goes out to vote first thing in the morning because their boss wants them to. Because it's a working day, it's easy to track their whereabouts.\"\nSix sources told Reuters on the eve of the election that executives at state-owned companies and organizations were pressuring employees to vote. Some will also have to provide evidence that they voted, four of them said.\nAn employee of a state-owned enterprise said: \"In our factory, everyone was told to vote on March 15 and send a selfie to the boss.\"\nThe high turnout is important to the Kremlin as Putin wants to show that the country still supports him two years after the start of the Russo-Ukrainian war.\nOfficial data showed that the national turnout on Friday exceeded 33%, but it exceeded 60% in Siberia and the Far East. In the Russian-occupied Donetsk and Kherson regions of Ukraine, the turnout was closer to 70%.\nSupporters of opposition politician Alexei Navalny, who died in an Arctic prison last month, are urging people to vote en masse at noon on Sunday in protest.\nAndreichuk said that in this general election, people in about one-third of the country can vote electronically. He believes this is a particular concern because it is easily manipulated and the results of the vote cannot be checked.\nHe also said that the voting time span was as long as three days, so the results could be tampered with overnight.\nAndreichuk also criticized the fact that there were only three candidates besides Putin, the smallest number of contenders in the past five elections, and that public discussion of national issues was not allowed.\n\"The authorities implemented censorship, there was repression in the country, and some opponents were sent to prison. Therefore, this election was not free and undemocratic from the beginning,\" Andreychuk said.\nGolos were prohibited from sending observers.

However, since the beginning of voting, there have been about 280,000 cyber attacks against electronic voting systems, with the attacks mainly originating from Ukraine, Western Europe and North America. In addition, on the Russian-Ukrainian battlefield, the Ukrainian army continued to use drones and missiles to attack Russian territory, and even shelled polling stations in an attempt to interfere with the election.\nVoting for this general election is scheduled to end at 20:00 Moscow time on the 17th. As of about four hours before the end of voting, the turnout had exceeded 70%, which was higher than the 67.5% turnout in the 2018 general election.

Data from Russian Telecom showed that the voting system suffered more than 90,000 attacks on the 15th.\nLapunov, the company\u2019s vice president for information security, pointed out that the source IP addresses of these network attacks are mainly located in Ukraine, Western Europe and North America. He also pointed out that judging from the professionalism of cyber attacks, these attacks were launched by \"professional special organizations.\" The Russian Foreign Intelligence Service said in a statement that the United States was trying to undermine the election results by reducing voter turnout. \"Instigated by Washington, the opposition is spreading calls on Russian citizens to ignore the election through Internet resources.\"\nIn addition, during the voting period, there were more than 20 incidents of attempts to destroy ballots by pouring various liquids into ballot boxes, 8 attempted arson incidents, and 1 incident of throwing smoke bombs at various polling stations, resulting in 214 ballots being destroyed. Several people were arrested for vandalism at polling stations.\nPamfilova accused these saboteurs of being \"scum\" and \"destroyed people's votes\", and revealed that some saboteurs admitted to being instructed by others to deliberately disrupt the election, and were paid as much as 100,000 rubles (approximately HK$8,500). Former Russian President Medvedev called these people \"traitors\", accused them of helping the country's enemies, and said that the perpetrators may have committed treason and may face 20 years in prison. Some members of Congress have proposed legislation that would punish those who disrupt election activities with up to eight years in prison.\nUkrainian army steps up attacks on targets in Russia\nIn addition to the cyber battlefield, Ukraine has repeatedly attacked oil refineries in Russia since before the election and sent troops to try to break through the Russian border. The Russian Ministry of Defense stated on the 17th that it had shot down 23 Ukrainian \"Vampire\" rockets and 168 drones in the past 24 hours alone.\nRussian Presidential Press Secretary Peskov said that the Ukrainian army has attempted to invade Belgorod and Kursk regions several times in recent days, but all attacks have been successfully repelled. \u201c1,700 of the 2,500 saboteurs were killed, 550 Loss of life\".
