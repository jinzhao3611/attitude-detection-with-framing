to data released by the Russian Central Election Commission in the early morning of the 18th local time, among the 85% of votes counted in the Russian presidential election, current President Putin led other candidates by a wide margin with 87.19% of the votes, and has actually won the presidential election.\nAnalysts believe that after Putin's re-election, Russia's domestic and foreign affairs will continue its existing policies, including focusing on strengthening technological independence, promoting economic diversification, actively developing relations with friendly countries in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America, and promoting the development of a multi-polar world. .\nwin\nThe official voting for Russia's eighth presidential election was held from the 15th to the 17th. A total of four candidates participated in the election, including the current Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Russian Liberal Democratic Party's Slutsky, the Russian Federation's Communist Party Kharitonov and the Russian newcomer Davankov of the party.\nAccording to data from the Russian Central Election Commission, among the 85% of votes counted in the Russian presidential election, Putin, Kharitonov, Davankov, and Slutsky received 87.19%, 4.24%, 3.99%, and 3.16% of the votes respectively. .\nAccording to Russian presidential election rules, the person who gets more than 50% of the votes in the election is elected president, so Putin has actually won the election. The Russian Central Election Commission will confirm the results of the presidential election no later than March 28 and announce them within 3 days after the election results are confirmed.\nIn the early morning of the 18th, Putin delivered a speech at the campaign headquarters, thanking all voters for their support. He said that Russia will move forward further and become more solid, stronger and more efficient.\nTechnical independence, economic diversification\nAfter the Russian economy suffered shocks in the early stages of the escalation of the Ukraine crisis, it has gradually shown resilience. Data released by the Russian Federal State Statistics Service in early February this year show that Russia\u2019s GDP will grow by 3.6% in 2023.

A total of four candidates participated in the election, including the current Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Russian Liberal Democratic Party's Slutsky, the Russian Federation's Communist Party Kharitonov and the Russian newcomer Davankov of the party.\nAccording to data from the Russian Central Election Commission, among the 85% of votes counted in the Russian presidential election, Putin, Kharitonov, Davankov, and Slutsky received 87.19%, 4.24%, 3.99%, and 3.16% of the votes respectively. .\nAccording to Russian presidential election rules, the person who gets more than 50% of the votes in the election is elected president, so Putin has actually won the election. The Russian Central Election Commission will confirm the results of the presidential election no later than March 28 and announce them within 3 days after the election results are confirmed.\nIn the early morning of the 18th, Putin delivered a speech at the campaign headquarters, thanking all voters for their support. He said that Russia will move forward further and become more solid, stronger and more efficient.\nTechnical independence, economic diversification\nAfter the Russian economy suffered shocks in the early stages of the escalation of the Ukraine crisis, it has gradually shown resilience. Data released by the Russian Federal State Statistics Service in early February this year show that Russia\u2019s GDP will grow by 3.6% in 2023.

Friday (March 15), voters in 11 time zones across Russia went to vote, kicking off the three-day Russian general election. The outside world generally believes that there is little doubt that Russian President Putin will win re-election. This election will \"give\" Putin another six years of power.\nVoters from some of Russia's more than 190 ethnic groups went to the polls, from Chukotka on the Pacific Ocean, 6,300 kilometers (3,900 miles) from Moscow, to the Baltic enclave of Kaliningrad on the border with Poland.\nAlthough Putin launched Europe's deadliest war since World War II in 2022, the Russian president still dominates Russia's political landscape. None of the other three candidates on the ballot in Russia's general election, which begins on Friday, poses any credible challenge to Putin. The three candidates are Vladislav Davankov of the New People party, Leonid Slutsky of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDPR) and Communist candidate Nikolay Kharitonov.\nThese rivals are known as \u201cinstitutional opposition.\u201d They are seen as symbolic rivals and their parties generally support Putin's government. CNBC said the purpose of including them on the ballot was to bring a level of respectability to the vote and provide a semblance of pluralism to Russia's de facto authoritarian political system.\nPutin is expected to easily win a fifth term, which will keep him in power in Russia until at least 2030.\nThe Kremlin says Putin will win because he will win widespread support to rescue Russia from post-Soviet chaos and stand up to an arrogant, hostile West.\nPutin has been president or prime minister of Russia since late 1999. So far, he has shown no sign of relinquishing control of Russia. He has the support of a loyal inner circle and Russia's security services.\nThe shadow of the war in Ukraine hangs over this Russian election: Russia still has more than 1 million armed personnel engaged in fierce fighting on Ukraine's 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) front line.\nDefense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of General Staff Valery Gerasimov, who are responsible for directing Russia's war efforts, voted in Russia's Southern Military District.\nMore than 114 million Russians are eligible to vote, including voters in what Russia claims are \"new territories.\" In October 2022, Russia announced the annexation of four Ukrainian regions. Ukraine says the Russian elections held there are illegal and invalid.\nUkraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement on Thursday (March 14) that Russia's attempts to \"imitate\" the presidential election on its territory showed that \"the Russian Federation continues to blatantly ignore the norms and principles of international law.\" The foreign ministry said voting in Ukrainian territories occupied by Russia was illegal and urged citizens in those areas not to vote.\nAnalysts pointed out that the Kremlin hopes to see high turnout in this election and hopes for a major victory for Putin to legitimize the war.\nAndreas Tursa, Central and Eastern Europe consultant at consulting firm Teneo, commented on Thursday: \"The Kremlin seeks an election result that will show public overwhelming support for Putin and his domestic and foreign policy agenda. sexual support.\u201d\nHe added: \"The Kremlin is using this election to reaffirm Putin's legitimacy, mobilize public support for his policies and demonstrate unity and resolve to external opponents.\" The Kremlin seeks a \"landslide victory.\"\nRussian opposition activists condemned the election. Most of them fled overseas to avoid arrest, imprisonment or assault. Yulia Navalnaya, the widow of late opposition leader Alexei Navalny, asked Russian voters to vote for \"any candidate other than Putin\" and called on Citizens voted collectively at noon local time on March 17 in an attempt to overwhelm the polling stations.\nShe also called on the West not to recognize the election results. Kremlin opponents have also called on supporters abroad to protest outside the Russian embassy this Sunday.","uid":"03_00_75","input":"On Friday (March 15), voters in 11 time zones across Russia went to vote, kicking off the three-day Russian general election.

This election will \"give\" Putin another six years of power.\nVoters from some of Russia's more than 190 ethnic groups went to the polls, from Chukotka on the Pacific Ocean, 6,300 kilometers (3,900 miles) from Moscow, to the Baltic enclave of Kaliningrad on the border with Poland.\nAlthough Putin launched Europe's deadliest war since World War II in 2022, the Russian president still dominates Russia's political landscape. None of the other three candidates on the ballot in Russia's general election, which begins on Friday, poses any credible challenge to Putin. The three candidates are Vladislav Davankov of the New People party, Leonid Slutsky of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDPR) and Communist candidate Nikolay Kharitonov.\nThese rivals are known as \u201cinstitutional opposition.\u201d They are seen as symbolic rivals and their parties generally support Putin's government. CNBC said the purpose of including them on the ballot was to bring a level of respectability to the vote and provide a semblance of pluralism to Russia's de facto authoritarian political system.\nPutin is expected to easily win a fifth term, which will keep him in power in Russia until at least 2030.\nThe Kremlin says Putin will win because he will win widespread support to rescue Russia from post-Soviet chaos and stand up to an arrogant, hostile West.\nPutin has been president or prime minister of Russia since late 1999. So far, he has shown no sign of relinquishing control of Russia. He has the support of a loyal inner circle and Russia's security services.\nThe shadow of the war in Ukraine hangs over this Russian election: Russia still has more than 1 million armed personnel engaged in fierce fighting on Ukraine's 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) front line.\nDefense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of General Staff Valery Gerasimov, who are responsible for directing Russia's war efforts, voted in Russia's Southern Military District.\nMore than 114 million Russians are eligible to vote, including voters in what Russia claims are \"new territories.\" In October 2022, Russia announced the annexation of four Ukrainian regions. Ukraine says the Russian elections held there are illegal and invalid.\nUkraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement on Thursday (March 14) that Russia's attempts to \"imitate\" the presidential election on its territory showed that \"the Russian Federation continues to blatantly ignore the norms and principles of international law.\" The foreign ministry said voting in Ukrainian territories occupied by Russia was illegal and urged citizens in those areas not to vote.\nAnalysts pointed out that the Kremlin hopes to see high turnout in this election and hopes for a major victory for Putin to legitimize the war.\nAndreas Tursa, Central and Eastern Europe consultant at consulting firm Teneo, commented on Thursday: \"The Kremlin seeks an election result that will show public overwhelming support for Putin and his domestic and foreign policy agenda. sexual support.\u201d\nHe added: \"The Kremlin is using this election to reaffirm Putin's legitimacy, mobilize public support for his policies and demonstrate unity and resolve to external opponents.\" The Kremlin seeks a \"landslide victory.\"\nRussian opposition activists condemned the election. Most of them fled overseas to avoid arrest, imprisonment or assault. Yulia Navalnaya, the widow of late opposition leader Alexei Navalny, asked Russian voters to vote for \"any candidate other than Putin\" and called on Citizens voted collectively at noon local time on March 17 in an attempt to overwhelm the polling stations.\nShe also called on the West not to recognize the election results. Kremlin opponents have also called on supporters abroad to protest outside the Russian embassy this Sunday."}

processed 99.79% of the protocols), Vladimir Putin won 87.3% with a turnout of 77.4%. This is a record for modern Russia: both in terms of the number of votes for the winner and in overall turnout. Moreover, Putin polled more than Alexander Lukashenko ever did - and came very close to the records of Central Asian autocrats, who usually poll more than 90%.\n\nThe political bloc of the Russian Presidential Administration (AP) actually exceeded the KPIs set before these elections. As Meduza has repeatedly written before, the AP set the task for regional administrations to achieve 80% for Putin and a turnout of more than 70%. Meduza has at its disposal an election strategy drawn up by the leadership of one of the regions of the Russian Federation: in this document, the goal for the elections is indicated exactly like this. It was planned to achieve this goal primarily through the mobilization of public sector employees and employees of companies close to the state.\n\nAt the same time, according to two regional officials who spoke to Meduza on condition of anonymity, in the last weeks before the elections the Administration began to receive \u201cwishes for the plus to 80% [for Putin] to be larger.\u201d As a result, the figure of 80% began to be perceived as an absolute minimum, and many regions began to focus on 85%. Meduza\u2019s interlocutor, close to the Presidential Administration, emphasized that the head of the internal political bloc, Sergei Kiriyenko, really \u201cwanted to show the president very high numbers - which is what he did.\u201d\n\nHowever, a political strategist working with the administration of one of the regions of the Russian Federation, in a conversation with Meduza, highlighted another factor in Putin\u2019s high result: \u201cThis is the Far East. They sum up the results earlier, and then other regions want to show better numbers. They set the bar wow.\u201d Indeed, in most regions included in the Far Eastern Federal District, Putin scored more than 85%. He received 80% of the votes only in the Khabarovsk Territory - this region, which was not so long ago headed by Sergei Furgal, is considered traditionally a protest region in the AP.\n\nAn official working in one of the Far Eastern regions told Meduza that the presidential embassy was 85% in favor of Putin. In the Far Eastern Federal District, it is headed by Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Trutnev: \u201cHe wanted to show that the Far East is the president\u2019s support, and not a protest territory. Showed me what you have to say.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, the Kremlin does not see a problem with Putin\u2019s such a high result. Two Meduza sources close to the AP emphasized that Kiriyenko is satisfied with the election results - and does not consider them \u201can excess or a painted cranberry.\u201d According to Meduza\u2019s interlocutor, close to the leadership of United Russia, Kiriyenko has already personally called most of the Russian governors and thanked them for their help in the elections.\n\n\u201cNo matter what anyone says - \u2018they overshot\u2019, \u2018overdid it\u2019 - they are not punished for winning. The senior manager likes it. He perceives this as real support. SVK [Sergei Kiriyenko] knows how to present and sell it to him. This is the main thing,\u201d emphasized one of the sources close to the Kremlin.\n\nAn interlocutor close to the AP drew special attention to the results of the elections in Moscow. In the capital, Vladimir Putin, according to official data, received more than 85% of the vote, that is, not much less than the national average: \u201cPreviously there was a lag - in the last campaign by more than 5%. Now Moscow is an exemplary loyal region. [Mayor Sergei] Sobyanin can sell this to the president as his achievement - he pacified the capital.\u201d\n\nCommunist Nikolai Kharitonov took second place in the elections (he scored a little more than 4%). The third, with a slight lag, was the candidate from the \u201cNew People\u201d Vladislav Davankov (many Russian oppositionists called for voting for him as the most liberal candidate). The last place was taken by the leader of the LDPR Leonid Slutsky, who scored a little more than 3%.\n\nInitially, the AP hoped that Slutsky would become the second, but he failed the campaign - and they did not dare to make significant falsifications for the sake of his relative success in the Kremlin. On election day, Meduza\u2019s interlocutors close to the presidential administration said that Davankov would most likely take second place, but indicated that Kharitonov also had a chance.\n\n\u201cDavankov would not be prevented [from becoming second]. In many regions, he actually came in second place, but fell short. And the crazy electorate of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation came for Kharitonov. Plus, he was more comfortable for the administrations of the southern regions and national republics, which did not understand Davankov,\u201d explained a source close to the Kremlin. According to him, pro-state media, however, will position Kharitonov\u2019s result as a defeat for the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, which received \u201ca record low result and did not reach 10%.\u201d\n\nIn general, as Meduza already wrote, the Kremlin administrators were not very worried about who exactly would take second place in the country: \u201cKharitonov was not interfered with either.

interesting is that after once again \u201cbreaking into\u201d the polling place at a public art training institution on Michiulin Street without any hope, the security guard faced our justified request of \u201cwe\u2019re curious and want to see how it\u2019s done.\u201d Two or three leaders asked for permission and finally agreed to let him go. The interior layout of the polling station is quite simple. A classroom was vacated and a high platform with four candidates on it was placed for people to fill in the forms. All three electronic voting machines had black screens and were not working. Further ahead was a row of long tables with people sitting behind them. Several Board of Elections staff and supervisors. During the short stay, people came to vote in groups of twos and threes. Including the staff, security guards, standing leaders and us, two incompatible \"curious babies\" in the small room, the number of voters far outnumbered the voters. The internal scene of the polling station has actually not changed much from what it was 12 years ago. Today, my trip was finally worthwhile and I left happily. Before leaving, the security guard was amused when he saw the two of us looking satisfied, and couldn't help but asked, \"Do you still like it?\"\nElection posters at the polling station entrance\n\nAnother significant difference from 12 years ago is that the publicity for this vote is low-key and the political atmosphere is no longer strong. Except for various advertisements at roadside sites, there seemed to be no atmosphere of an election going on. As online voting becomes more popular, offline sites continue to decrease, and the site in the main building of Moscow State University is no longer set up. What changes technology will bring to elections remains to be seen, but the ritual of putting one person, one vote into the ballot box is irreplaceable.\nOn the same day as the general election, the focus of publicity in Moscow was also distracted by other cultural activities, giving a sense of \"a hundred flowers blooming.\" For example, this week is also the grand folk festival \"Meat Lent\" before the Orthodox Lent. There are many market stalls with different themes in Moscow, selling the must-have delicacies of the festival \"pancakes\", scarecrows and various handicrafts. Full of rich program list. We planned to go straight to the polling station, but we couldn't help but be hindered by the variety of activities on the way. We visited three festival markets located near different city attractions.\nThe grand \"Masantensa\" market stage in the center of Moscow\n\nThe \u201cReturn Commemoration\u201d event in Red Square and the shadow of the Russia-Ukraine conflict\nUnexpectedly, Red Square, which was thought to be a key area for election voting, is actually making intensive preparations for another political event to be held after the election. Huge exhibition boards and stages were set up throughout the venue, with printed promotional signs to welcome the 10th anniversary of Crimea's \"return to the motherland.\" The entrance to St. Basil's Cathedral was also blocked by stage equipment and prevented visitors from approaching. Take a photo with the huge display board and the \"colorful onions\".\nPreparations for the next event on Red Square\n\nAfter the completion of the constitutional referendum in 2020, Putin will have the opportunity to run again and be re-elected for 12 years. This election marks the beginning of a new re-election. The protracted conflict between Russia and Ukraine has also had a certain impact on the 2024 presidential election. On the one hand, important plans related to Russia's future can only be postponed due to the impact of the war. Currently, Putin is still the key to uniting the elite and ordinary people. On the other hand, \"special military operations\" will inevitably have a certain impact on Russian social life, which has also become a problem that Putin will face in this election. However, the Russian economy will recover in 2023 compared to 2022, and all aspects of life have basically adapted to the new wartime normal. This is of great value in stabilizing the election results.\nIn early 2024, the Russian army captured Avdeyevka, which was held by the Ukrainian army, which became a bonus in the general election in a sense. The election is proceeding steadily with the guarantee, organization and promotion of the Russian governments at all levels. However, Moscow\u2019s Red Square seems to be staying out of the election, preparing for the commemoration of the \u201c10th anniversary of the return of Crimea\u201d. From this point of view, the tasks contained in this election to steadily advance the political process and maintain social stability and normal operation have been basically achieved.","uid":"03_07_33","input":"What\u2019s interesting is that after once again \u201cbreaking into\u201d the polling place at a public art training institution on Michiulin Street without any hope, the security guard faced our justified request of \u201cwe\u2019re curious and want to see how it\u2019s done.\u201d Two or three leaders asked for permission and finally agreed to let him go. The interior layout of the polling station is quite simple. A classroom was vacated and a high platform with four candidates on it was placed for people to fill in the forms. All three electronic voting machines had black screens and were not working. Further ahead was a row of long tables with people sitting behind them. Several Board of Elections staff and supervisors. During the short stay, people came to vote in groups of twos and threes. Including the staff, security guards, standing leaders and us, two incompatible \"curious babies\" in the small room, the number of voters far outnumbered the voters. The internal scene of the polling station has actually not changed much from what it was 12 years ago. Today, my trip was finally worthwhile and I left happily. Before leaving, the security guard was amused when he saw the two of us looking satisfied, and couldn't help but asked, \"Do you still like it?\"\nElection posters at the polling station entrance\n\nAnother significant difference from 12 years ago is that the publicity for this vote is low-key and the political atmosphere is no longer strong. Except for various advertisements at roadside sites, there seemed to be no atmosphere of an election going on. As online voting becomes more popular, offline sites continue to decrease, and the site in the main building of Moscow State University is no longer set up. What changes technology will bring to elections remains to be seen, but the ritual of putting one person, one vote into the ballot box is irreplaceable.\nOn the same day as the general election, the focus of publicity in Moscow was also distracted by other cultural activities, giving a sense of \"a hundred flowers blooming.\" For example, this week is also the grand folk festival \"Meat Lent\" before the Orthodox Lent. There are many market stalls with different themes in Moscow, selling the must-have delicacies of the festival \"pancakes\", scarecrows and various handicrafts. Full of rich program list. We planned to go straight to the polling station, but we couldn't help but be hindered by the variety of activities on the way. We visited three festival markets located near different city attractions.\nThe grand \"Masantensa\" market stage in the center of Moscow\n\nThe \u201cReturn Commemoration\u201d event in Red Square and the shadow of the Russia-Ukraine conflict\nUnexpectedly, Red Square, which was thought to be a key area for election voting, is actually making intensive preparations for another political event to be held after the election. Huge exhibition boards and stages were set up throughout the venue, with printed promotional signs to welcome the 10th anniversary of Crimea's \"return to the motherland.\" The entrance to St. Basil's Cathedral was also blocked by stage equipment and prevented visitors from approaching. Take a photo with the huge display board and the \"colorful onions\".\nPreparations for the next event on Red Square\n\nAfter the completion of the constitutional referendum in 2020, Putin will have the opportunity to run again and be re-elected for 12 years. This election marks the beginning of a new re-election. The protracted conflict between Russia and Ukraine has also had a certain impact on the 2024 presidential election. On the one hand, important plans related to Russia's future can only be postponed due to the impact of the war. Currently, Putin is still the key to uniting the elite and ordinary people. On the other hand, \"special military operations\" will inevitably have a certain impact on Russian social life, which has also become a problem that Putin will face in this election. However, the Russian economy will recover in 2023 compared to 2022, and all aspects of life have basically adapted to the new wartime normal. This is of great value in stabilizing the election results.\nIn early 2024, the Russian army captured Avdeyevka, which was held by the Ukrainian army, which became a bonus in the general election in a sense. The election is proceeding steadily with the guarantee, organization and promotion of the Russian governments at all levels. However, Moscow\u2019s Red Square seems to be staying out of the election, preparing for the commemoration of the \u201c10th anniversary of the return of Crimea\u201d.

The first category is the political parties that have entered the Russian State Duma, currently including the United Russia Party, the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, the Russian Liberal Democratic Party, the Public Russia Party (the \"Just Russia-Patriots-For Truth\" Party) and the New People's Party. Candidates nominated by the above-mentioned political parties will be registered directly as candidates. For other political parties that have not entered the Russian State Duma, candidates nominated by them need to collect the signatures of 100,000 supporters and submit them to the Russian Central Committee for review.\nFor self-recommended candidates, obtaining qualifications is more complicated. It first needs to convene an initiative group of no less than 500 people. The group participants must vote by majority to approve the self-recommended person's candidacy. It also needs to collect the signatures of at least 300,000 supporters from 40 or more regions. Candidates can be registered only after the review by the Russian-Chinese Election Commission.\nAmong the four candidates for the 2024 Russian general election, only Putin is an independent candidate and qualified to run through self-recommendation. The remaining three people were nominated by the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, the Russian Communist Party, and the New People's Party.\nAccording to previous reports from Xinhua News Agency, Pamfilova, chairwoman of the Russian Central Election Commission, announced at a press conference on January 29 this year that Putin had been officially registered as a candidate for the 2024 presidential election. Among the approximately 315,000 signatures of supporters submitted by Putin\u2019s campaign headquarters, the Central Election Commission randomly selected 60,000 signatures for verification. The results showed that 91 signatures were invalid and complied with the relevant regulations for registering as a candidate for the presidential election.","uid":"03_07_35","input":"For those who meet the regulations and intend to participate in the presidential election, they can participate in the election through two methods: party nomination and self-recommendation.\nThere are two situations in this method of party nomination. The first category is the political parties that have entered the Russian State Duma, currently including the United Russia Party, the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, the Russian Liberal Democratic Party, the Public Russia Party (the \"Just Russia-Patriots-For Truth\" Party) and the New People's Party. Candidates nominated by the above-mentioned political parties will be registered directly as candidates. For other political parties that have not entered the Russian State Duma, candidates nominated by them need to collect the signatures of 100,000 supporters and submit them to the Russian Central Committee for review.\nFor self-recommended candidates, obtaining qualifications is more complicated. It first needs to convene an initiative group of no less than 500 people. The group participants must vote by majority to approve the self-recommended person's candidacy. It also needs to collect the signatures of at least 300,000 supporters from 40 or more regions.

two countries are politically authoritarian, and Xi Jinping also refers to many of Putin's practices.\nLai Rongwei said that under the siege of a democratic society, the CCP needs a cooperative partner. While Putin is deeply involved in the war in Ukraine and Russia is sanctioned by Western society, the economic complementarity between Russia and China is now higher than before.\nThe Russia-Ukraine war, which has lasted for more than two years, is still in a stalemate. Last month, China confirmed that Putin will visit China again this year. This will be Putin's 19th visit to China since taking power in Russia.\nAccording to statistics from the General Administration of Customs of the Communist Party of China, in 2022, the bilateral trade volume between China and Russia reached a record high of 190.27 billion U.S. dollars, a year-on-year increase of 29.3%. When the Russo-Ukrainian war broke out and Russia faced sanctions from Western societies, China became Russia's most important trading partner.\nAfter the Russian presidential election, Putin warned on March 18 that if Russia had a direct conflict with NATO, it would be only one step away from the so-called World War III. The European Union issued another warning to Putin and determined to continue supporting Ukraine.\nLai Rongwei said that anyone can say cruel things like Putin, just like Kim Jong-un who talks about blowing up South Korea all day long. This is just a kind of intimidation. But the international community must also unite and collectively deter it. Just like Taiwan wants to deter the CCP, the best way is to unite all Taiwanese friends.\nOn March 22, 2023, Xi Jinping ended his three-day visit to Russia. When leaving the Kremlin, he said something to Putin, saying that \"we will promote the so-called changes in a century together.\" Putin responded in agreement. At that time, outsiders believed that what Xi was hinting at was an attempt to join forces to disrupt the \"world order.\"\nLai Rongwei said that the two authoritarian regimes of China and Russia are now joining forces to overthrow the international order, and their main enemies are the United States and the European Union.\nWeng Mingxian said that there is another influencing factor in the so-called century-old changes, that is, the US presidential election will be held on November 5. If Biden is elected, it will continue to create a tense situation in which the United States has to deal with the strategic alliance between China and Russia. But another variable is that if Trump is elected, with Trump\u2019s leadership style, he may put the United States first to implement global strategy, which will also pose another risk to the so-called global strategic pattern of China and Russia.\nLai Rongwei said that no matter whether Trump or Biden is president of the United States, the confrontation between Russia and NATO and the confrontation between the United States and China will continue.\nHe analyzed that because China and Russia are considered to be the evil camp, this points to confrontation with the West in terms of values. For example, the United States often names Russia and China for interfering in their elections, and Taiwan has also been talking about the CCP's cognitive warfare. Both China and Russia are using vague spaces and techniques to change the status quo, and are using the values \u200b\u200bof Western liberal democracy and the normal state of economic freedom to carry out their conspiratorial infiltration.

Russia was strongly condemned by the United States and Western allies and imposed rounds of severe sanctions. However, Beijing not only failed to accuse Moscow of its aggressive actions, but instead took the opportunity to strengthen political, diplomatic, and economic and trade relations with Russia, and even bought energy products that Russia was forced to sell at a discount due to Western sanctions.\nBefore launching the war in Ukraine, Putin made a special visit to Beijing and signed a series of cooperation documents with Xi Jinping known as \"unlimited\". China and Russia have obvious intentions of holding back-to-back to warm up in the face of resistance from the United States and the West.\nThe United States currently positions China as its biggest strategic competitor and views Russia as the country that poses the greatest threat. President Biden has repeatedly stated that competition and confrontation between the two camps of democracy and authoritarianism will continue throughout the 21st century.\nReuters reported that Xi Jinping and Putin share the same world view and both view the West as decadent and declining, while China is challenging the United States\u2019 hegemony in many fields, including almost everything from quantum computing to synthetic biology to military technology and power. .\nPutin is scheduled to hold a new presidential inauguration around May 7. Western diplomats and observers have long predicted that Putin would choose Beijing as the first stop of his overseas trip during his new term.\nPutin told reporters on Sunday that Russia and China have similar views on global affairs and that their relationship is highly resilient because of his close personal relationship with Xi. Putin said that Moscow and Beijing will further deepen their bilateral relations in the coming years.\nXi Jinping also visited Moscow in March last year, shortly after breaking with decades of CCP practice to seek a third term. Putin and Xi Jinping often boast of their close relationship and have met more than 40 times.

Li Hui, the Chinese government's special representative for Eurasian affairs, has visited Russia, Ukraine and many European countries twice, claiming to be a thread for peace. However, because China's peace proposal does not address the key demand of Russia's withdrawal from occupied Ukrainian territories, Kyiv and its Western allies are not particularly optimistic about Beijing's mediation efforts.\nChina's ambassador to Switzerland Wang Shiting said in an interview with Swiss media on Monday that Beijing was considering participating in a peace conference that Switzerland will host in a few months to end the war in Ukraine.","uid":"03_00_28","input":"Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, when asked about Reuters reports about Putin's upcoming visit to China, said that information about Putin's visit will be released closer to the date.\n\"We are currently planning several presidential visits and several high-level contacts,\" Peskov told reporters. \"We will let you know as the date approaches.\"\nAfter Putin brazenly invaded Ukraine in February 2022, Russia was strongly condemned by the United States and Western allies and imposed rounds of severe sanctions.

News Service, Moscow, March 18 (Reporter Tian Bing) Russian presidential candidate and current President Vladimir Putin said at his first press conference after the election voting on the 18th that he would do his best to achieve the country's main tasks and goals.\nAt 7:00 a.m. Moscow time on the 18th, the Russian Central Election Commission announced the counting results of 99.43% of the votes. Putin won 87.32% of the support in the 2024 presidential election. Putin has actually won the election.\nKharitonov, the candidate nominated by the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, received 4.32% of the votes, Davankov, the candidate nominated by the Russian New People's Party, received 3.79% of the votes, and Slutsky, the candidate nominated by the Russian Liberal Democratic Party, received 3.19% of the votes.\nPutin came to the campaign headquarters near the Kremlin to deliver a speech in the early morning of the 18th, and then held a press conference.\nPutin said that the source of Russian power is the people, and the votes of every Russian citizen constitute the unified will of the people. He will continue to promote national development in his new term.\nPutin pointed out that all the main tasks and goals of Russia's development have been elaborated in the recent State of the Union address to both houses of parliament, and he will do his best to achieve the set goals. Russia will move forward and become stronger, more powerful and more efficient.\nRegarding the Ukrainian issue, Putin stated that the initiative on the frontline of the special military operation against Ukraine lies entirely in the hands of the Russian army. The issue of special military operations and strengthening Russia's defense capabilities are one of the main tasks of his new term. He said that Russia supports peace negotiations, but not just because the other side is running out of bullets, but if they truly, seriously and long-term hope that the two countries can establish peace, Russia supports negotiations on the Ukrainian issue. \"This is a very serious issue.\"\nPutin also said that considering the Ukrainian army's attacks on Russia's Belgorod region and other places, Russia does not rule out the possibility of establishing a \"safe zone\" in the border area at some point.\nRegarding the United States, Putin once again stated that Russia has no preference for any American presidential candidate and that Russia is ready to cooperate with any American leader that American voters vote for.\nWhen answering the question of whether a full-scale conflict between Russia and NATO is possible and how likely it is, Putin said, \"Everything is possible in the modern world.\" He pointed out that there are currently military personnel from NATO countries in Ukraine, and they are \"dying in large numbers.\"\nRegarding Sino-Russian relations, Putin said that after years of development, Russia-China relations are very stable and highly complementary. Putin pointed out that Russia and China have many points of convergence in economic, diplomatic and other fields. As far as the development of the Eurasian region is concerned, Russia-China relations are an important stabilizing factor, and the joint construction of the \"Belt and Road\" initiative proposed by China is very important.\nPutin spoke positively of China's development achievements. He believes that China is achieving rapid development with great confidence and transforming into an innovative economy; China is increasingly active on the international stage and has achieved great success, and has many friends around the world.\nPutin emphasized that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China; those who seek provocation around Taiwan and take various measures to delay China's development will undoubtedly fail completely.\nOfficial voting for Russia\u2019s eighth presidential election will be held from the 15th to the 17th. The Russian-Chinese Election Commission announced that it will confirm the final results of this presidential election no later than March 28 and announce them within three days after confirmation.","uid":"00_06_15","input":"China News Service, Moscow, March 18 (Reporter Tian Bing) Russian presidential candidate and current President Vladimir Putin said at his first press conference after the election voting on the 18th that he would do his best to achieve the country's main tasks and goals.\nAt 7:00 a.m. Moscow time on the 18th, the Russian Central Election Commission announced the counting results of 99.43% of the votes.

No one.\" Sergey predicted the topic. direction, responding to Nikita\u2019s somewhat \u201coutrageous\u201d remarks with angry eyes, \u201cFirst it was Gorbachev, then Yeltsin, and now Putin, we are always retreating, can\u2019t you see? \"\nRussia has the largest land area in the world, a large military, and a powerful nuclear arsenal. Its people generally feel confident in its military power. Therefore, it is not easy for outsiders to put themselves in Russia\u2019s security dilemma.\nOn May 9, 2023 local time, in Moscow, Russia, soldiers lined up during the Victory Day military parade on Red Square to commemorate the 78th anniversary of the end of World War II.\n\nNikita explained this \"paranoia\" about security to The Paper reporter: \"I won't tell you a lot of history, just one thing. The word 'security' in Russian is \u0431\u0435\u0437\u043e\u043f\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c, which literally means ' \"There is no danger.\" This is different from the way words are formed in English, French, and German, and I'm afraid it's also different from Chinese. \"\n\"Language can reflect people's subconscious thinking. So you can see how afraid Russians are of external dangers,\" he said.\nIn fact, this mentality is also reflected in Russian official discourse. In order to deal with Western sanctions and external risks, the Russian government has formulated a package of strategies. Among them, the plan named \"Fortress Russia\" aims to increase the resilience of Russia's economy and society and further reduce its dependence on the West. In fact, as early as 2005, when relations with the West were still in the \"honeymoon\", a Russian official think tank suggested in a policy document titled \"Fortress Russia\" that an \"isolationist\" policy (and even a world view) that would effectively reduce foreign dependence would be It is feasible in the long run.\n\u201cThe so-called \u2018isolationism\u2019 refers to a mode of national existence in which the government only establishes and maintains relatively limited external contacts."}

to reports from Xinhua News Agency on December 8, citing TASS, Russia Today and other media, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that day that he would participate in the presidential election in 2024. Pamfilova, chairwoman of the Russian Central Election Commission, announced on the 8th that voting in the 2024 Russian presidential election will be held for three days, lasting from March 15th to 17th.\nThis will be Russia's first three-day presidential election vote. The multi-day voting method has previously been used during the coronavirus pandemic to prevent overcrowding of voters at polling stations. It is reported that the first application of this method was during the Russian constitutional referendum from June 25 to July 1, 2020.\nIn addition, voting in this presidential election will also be conducted using a combination of on-site voting and remote electronic voting. Voters can apply for remote electronic voting from January 29 to March 11, 2024. The official voting time is March 15 From 8:00 on Sunday to 20:00 on March 17. At present, the Russian Central Election Commission has not announced the regions where remote electronic voting can be used. Russia's Central Election Commission is expected to make a decision on December 12 on whether to hold voting in the four \"new regions\" of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporozhye and Kherson.\nOn December 8, Putin attended the \"Heroes of the Motherland Day\" celebration ceremony at the Kremlin. After the ceremony, Artyom Zoga, Chairman of the People's Committee of the \"Donetsk People's Republic\", said in a conversation with Putin that the entire Donbas region hopes that Putin will participate in the election.\nHe said to Putin: \"You are our president, we are your team. We need you, Russia needs you.\" In response, Putin responded: \"I had different ideas at different times, but now the time has come to do what must be done It\u2019s time to make a decision. I will run for president of Russia.\u201d\nAfter Putin announced his participation in the 2024 election, many Russian officials expressed support.\nMatviyenko, chairman of the Russian Federation Council (the upper house of parliament), said that Putin\u2019s decision is a guarantee for Russia as a strong, secure and sovereign country.\nVolodin, chairman of the Russian State Duma (lower house of parliament), said that Putin's decision to participate in the election is very important for Russia and the world. Putin's decision demonstrates his love for Russia and his desire to make Russia strong and prosperous. It also demonstrates his desire to protect Russia in the current difficult period full of challenges and threats.\nMedvedev, deputy chairman of the Security Council of the Russian Federation, said that considering the current situation, Putin's decision is absolutely reasonable and correct, and Putin should continue to serve as president.\nIf the 71-year-old Putin can win the general election in March 2024 and be successfully re-elected, it will be his fifth term as President of Russia. Putin's current term as President of Russia will end on May 7, 2024. According to the Russian constitution, Putin can seek re-election for two terms until 2036 after this term ends.\nCurrently, among the five political parties in the Russian parliament, the United Russia Party and the \"Just Russia-Patriots-For Truth\" party have made it clear that they will support Putin's presidential bid. Zyuganov, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, has previously stated that he will participate in the election, but the final decision will be made by the Central Committee of the Party. The Russian Liberal Democratic Party and the Newcomer Party are also expected to nominate presidential candidates from their respective parties.\nOutside parliament, Yabolu party leader Yavlinsky said that if he could collect 100,000 signatures from supporters to qualify for the election, he would run for president. Independent candidates, including former Russian local TV reporter Yekaterina Duntsova who called for an end to \"special military operations,\" need to convene an initiative group of at least 500 people and obtain more than 300,000 signatures from supporters. Only in order to be eligible to participate in the election.","uid":"03_07_101","input":"According to reports from Xinhua News Agency on December 8, citing TASS, Russia Today and other media, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that day that he would participate in the presidential election in 2024.

I will run for president of Russia.\u201d\nAfter Putin announced his participation in the 2024 election, many Russian officials expressed support.\nMatviyenko, chairman of the Russian Federation Council (the upper house of parliament), said that Putin\u2019s decision is a guarantee for Russia as a strong, secure and sovereign country.\nVolodin, chairman of the Russian State Duma (lower house of parliament), said that Putin's decision to participate in the election is very important for Russia and the world. Putin's decision demonstrates his love for Russia and his desire to make Russia strong and prosperous. It also demonstrates his desire to protect Russia in the current difficult period full of challenges and threats.\nMedvedev, deputy chairman of the Security Council of the Russian Federation, said that considering the current situation, Putin's decision is absolutely reasonable and correct, and Putin should continue to serve as president.\nIf the 71-year-old Putin can win the general election in March 2024 and be successfully re-elected, it will be his fifth term as President of Russia. Putin's current term as President of Russia will end on May 7, 2024. According to the Russian constitution, Putin can seek re-election for two terms until 2036 after this term ends.\nCurrently, among the five political parties in the Russian parliament, the United Russia Party and the \"Just Russia-Patriots-For Truth\" party have made it clear that they will support Putin's presidential bid. Zyuganov, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, has previously stated that he will participate in the election, but the final decision will be made by the Central Committee of the Party. The Russian Liberal Democratic Party and the Newcomer Party are also expected to nominate presidential candidates from their respective parties.\nOutside parliament, Yabolu party leader Yavlinsky said that if he could collect 100,000 signatures from supporters to qualify for the election, he would run for president. Independent candidates, including former Russian local TV reporter Yekaterina Duntsova who called for an end to \"special military operations,\" need to convene an initiative group of at least 500 people and obtain more than 300,000 signatures from supporters. Only in order to be eligible to participate in the election."}
