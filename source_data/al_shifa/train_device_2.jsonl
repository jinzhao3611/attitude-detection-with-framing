Israel\u2019s bombing of Gaza has also killed 102 aid workers with the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), making this the deadliest conflict ever for UN staff in the organisation\u2019s history.

Hence, there is no justification for civilians being attacked by either side in the current conflict, and it is unlawful. Neve Gordon, a professor of international law and human rights at Queen Mary University of London, said both Hamas\u2019s and Israel\u2019s actions were \u201cclearly war crimes\u201d, adding that it was \u201cobvious to anyone\u201d that Hamas\u2019s actions on October 7 violated IHL. \u201cIt is also obvious that Israel has committed war crimes in Gaza since October 7,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is the collective punishment through the stopping of water and electricity, the compelled movement of populations and then the unleashing of eruptive violence that is killing thousands of civilians while destroying the very infrastructure of existence in the Gaza Strip,\u201d Gordon added. Israel controls what goes in and out of Gaza. Even the fuel for its sole power plant, which has since shut down, has been supplied with Israel\u2019s permission. Israel\u2019s claims that Hamas is operating out of civilian facilities, however, are aimed at justifying civilian casualties, Gordon said. \u201cWhen Israel claims Hamas targets in refugee camps and hospitals, the idea in both cases is to underscore that the value of the target is extremely high and, therefore, that Israel is abiding by the principle of proportionality even if many civilians die,\u201d Gordon said.

The IDF is using an entire corridor in the hospital to hold the terrorists, which is serving as a temporary detention facility for the military intelligence and Shin Bet for interrogating terrorists, to obtain intelligence from them as quickly as possible. An IDF source toldArmy Radiothat \"we are sitting on a gold mine.\" Among the detainees were medium level Hamas commanders, including the Gaza Brigade Commander Izz a-Din al-Haddad. One of the detainees, an Islamic Jihad terrorist, recently fired rockets at the settlements surrounding the Gaza Strip. During his interrogation, he said, \"We left Shifa \u2013 we fired at Sderot \u2013 and returned to Shifa, because we understood it was a safe area.\" Also, during the activity at the hospital, the forces seized Hamas military archives and binders stolen by Hamas from the Erez crossing on October 7, including sensitive COGAT unit information. The IDF assesses that Hamas may have tried in recent months to re-excavate and rehabilitate the underground tunnel system under Shifa, but that the system, which was already destroyed during the war, does not enable terrorists to stay or escape.

There is a severe shortage of hospital beds, forcing some to share beds, while others sleep on the floor.\u00a0 There has been much speculation and unconfirmed reports about the timing and reasoning behind the latest raid on the hospital. The raid came at the same time as an Israeli delegation was expected to arrive in Qatar to review a Hamas ceasefire proposal.\u00a0 The negotiations are set to be mediated by Egypt, and will need to be approved by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, Israeli media reported.\u00a0 Meanwhile, a Palestinian police general was also killed by Israeli forces on Monday morning. According to Al Jazeera, he was in charge of securing the entry of aid trucks into northern Gaza.\u00a0 Citing unnamed sources, the Qatar-based network said Faiq Mabhouh, the director general of Gaza's police operations, was credited for the recent coordination between tribal leaders and Unrwa to secure and distribute aid coming from the south.\u00a0 His efforts resulted in the safe entry of aid trucks for two nights in a row, following weeks of Israeli targeting of convoys and aid seekers. The Israeli military said that Mabhouh was killed during an exchange of fire with troops during a raid on al-Shifa hospital and west Gaza City.\u00a0 The killing comes after reports said that civilian tribes in Gaza, who rejected any cooperation with Israel regarding the distribution of aid, had recently met at the courtyard of the hospital. In the meeting, the tribes said that they are willing to cooperate on the distribution of aid on the condition that it is done in collaboration with security services and government officials in Gaza.", "uid": "01_00_57", "stance": "neutral", "language": "English", "translation": "", "input": "Israel cut all electricity, aid, fuel, water and food. by Egypt mediate The negotiations. by Israeli forces kill a Palestinian police general.

WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Sunday that he was \u201cappalled by the effective destruction\u201d of Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza, leading to the deaths of at least eight patients and putting the facility out of service. After arresting the hospital\u2019s director, Ahmed al-Kahlot, Israel released an interrogation video Tuesday in which Kahlot admitted to being a member of Hamas and said the hospital was under the control of the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, the group\u2019s armed wing.", "uid": "01_00_185", "stance": "pos", "language": "English", "translation": "", "input": "Officials respond to a request for comment on the group \u2019s alleged use of the tunnels. the IDF publish an additional piece of evidence : security camera footage showing armed militants leading two hostages through the hospital on Oct. 7 \u2014 among some 240 captured during the assault on southern Israel. in the fighting damage almost half of the major medical facilities in northern Gaza.

Images shared on social media appeared to show fire engulfing the building, widespread damage and bodies scattered in the wreckage. Since Israel began pounding Gaza from the air on October 7 following an unprecedented attack by Hamas inside Israel, tens of thousands of people seeking refuge from the bombardment have fled to hospitals throughout Gaza. Israel blamed the blast at the hospital on a failed rocket launch by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group, which denied responsibility. Following the attack, anti-Israel protests erupted in the occupied West Bank and several cities across the Middle East, while Jordan cancelled a summit scheduled for Wednesday that was due to attended by the presidents of the United States, Egypt and the Palestinian Authority. PA President Mahmoud Abbas said the targeting of the hospital was a \u201chideous war massacre\u201d that could not be tolerated and withdrew from the meeting in Amman. The devastating attack on the hospital came on the eve of a trip to Israel by US President Joe Biden. The visit is expected to see him reaffirm US backing for Israel and try to stop the Israel-Hamas war from spiralling into wider conflict. As world leaders condemned the attack on the hospital, Russia\u2019s foreign ministry called on Israel to provide satellite images to prove that it was not involved. Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told Radio Sputnik that the attack was a shocking \u201cdehumanising\u201d crime.

Israeli spokesman Daniel Hagari said earlier that Hamas had \u201cturned hospitals into command and control centres and hideouts for Hamas terrorists and commanders\u201d. Hagari also accused Hamas of storing fuel for military operations inside hospitals in Gaza. The al-Shifa Medical Complex is the largest medical health institution within the Gaza Strip.

Thousands of Palestinian civilians have sought refuge at the hospital since Israel launched a devastating assault on Gaza on October 7 after Hamas attacked southern Israel. El-Reshiq warned that the claim was an attempt to \u201cpave the way for targeting a hospital that contains thousands of wounded and shelters more than 40,000 displaced people\u201d. The rejection came as Israel escalated its bombardment of Gaza, expanding air raids and artillery fire in a fierce barrage that knocked out phone and internet services across the Palestinian territory. Hagari said Israeli ground forces were \u201cexpanding operations\u201d in Gaza. Earlier on Friday, chief of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) Philippe Lazzarini said that aid meant for Palestinians in Gaza was not being diverted for use by Hamas. \u201cWe have solid monitoring mechanisms \u2026 UNRWA does not and will not divert any humanitarian aid into the wrong hands,\u201d he said.

The third is that war \u2013 like nature \u2013 abhors a vacuum.

But others are filling the yawning governance gap. There are criminal gangs, major families with their own quasi-militia, informal neighbourhood committees set up by desperate civilians and, inevitably, Hamas. The militant Islamist organisation has run Gaza since 2007 and its structures, overt and covert, are deeply embedded. So too are its ideas. This has not escaped even friends of Israel. The annual Threat Assessment of the US Intelligence Community, published last week, predicted that Israel \u201cprobably will face lingering armed resistance from Hamas for years to come, and the military will struggle to neutralise Hamas\u2019s underground infrastructure, which allows insurgents to hide, regain strength, and surprise Israeli forces\u201d.

Ismail Al-Thawabta, director of the Hamas-run government media office, said the misidentification and the inclusion of pictures of medical staff and people outside the country showed the Israeli military was spreading false narratives to justify its assault on the hospital.

It has been threatened by an armed group within an occupied territory. It cannot claim the right of self-defence against a threat that emanates from a territory it occupies, from a territory kept under belligerent occupation,\u201d Albanese said. Albanese was referring to a 2004 advisory opinion by the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which said the construction of Israel\u2019s separation wall in the occupied West Bank was illegal. The ICJ rejected the Israeli argument to build the wall, saying it could not invoke the right to self-defence in an occupied territory. Other experts point to the devastating scale of Israeli attacks on Gaza. \u201cThe death of a reported 4,710 children, attacks on healthcare, the withholding of water and electricity \u2013 these cannot be merely justified as a \u2018right to self-defence\u2019,\u201d said Iain Overton, executive director of the London-based Action on Armed Violence, which conducts research and advocacy on armed violence against civilians.

Armed conflicts are governed by international humanitarian law (IHL), a set of rules contained in international agreements like the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 as well as other agreements and conventions meant to ensure that all member nations subscribe to a list of fundamental rules during conflicts. But member states do not always act by the rules, most recently during the Ukraine-Russia war. Israel has been accused of war crimes in its previous military assaults on Gaza, but it has not been held accountable. In the current conflict, though, experts said Israel\u2019s actions seem to violate all of the four main principles of IHL: distinction between civilians and combatants, proportionality between anticipated loss of civilian life and damage and the strategic military advantage of an attack, legitimate military purposes and the humane treatment of all individuals from civilians to detainees and hostages.", "uid": "01_01_103", "stance": "neg", "language": "English", "translation": "", "input": "by another state threaten it. by an armed group within an occupied territory threaten It. it occupy territory.

The BBC not only dwarfs other outlets in its global reach but, most important of all, it is trusted everywhere as a kite-mark of objectivity.

There have been innumerable examples of the BBC\u2019s selective, distorted reporting, using Hamas propaganda as legitimate talking points and twisting itself into a pretzel to cast Israel in the worst possible light. On Oct. 17, a few hours after the first reports of an explosion at Gaza\u2019s Al-Ahli hospital that Hamas blamed on Israel, theBBC\u2019s International Editor Jeremy Bowen reported: \u201cThe missile hit the hospital not long after dark. \u2026 The explosion destroyed Al-Ahli hospital. \u2026 The building was flattened\u201d.

I didn\u2019t race to judgment.\u201d The only thing more astounding than such arrogance in the face of what was at best inexcusable sloppiness and at worst malign bias, is that theBBCcontinues to use Bowen as an authoritative commentator on the war in Gaza.

The fighting around the Shifa hospital and its eventual seizure was the climactic moment of the first phase of Israel\u2019s offensive in Gaza, launched last year after Hamas killed 1,200 and captured 250 people, mostly civilians, in a surprise raid on 7 October. There was bitter argument over whether the hospital\u2019s buildings and basements had been used by Hamas as a covert command centre, as Israel claimed, but none over the strength of Israel\u2019s control of the site when its soldiers moved in on 15 November. Three months later, Monday\u2019s raid is an implicit admission that this control seems to have slipped. It is clear that Hamas is operating in parts of northern Gaza that were supposed to have been cleared by Israeli forces a long time ago. In February, there was fighting in Zeitoun, a neighbourhood of Gaza City, and al-Shati camp, further up the coast. There have even been clashes in Beit Hanoun, which was one of the first places overrun by Israeli forces at the very beginning of the war. Three things are happening. One is that, though Hamas has sustained heavy casualties, it still has enough men under arms and sufficiently functional command systems to launch sporadic attacks on Israeli troops when circumstances are right. Its extensive tunnel system helps here. These cause little damage and few casualties but will add to pressure on Israel in any talks over a ceasefire and hostage for prisoner exchange. They will also help Hamas frame the conflict\u2019s eventual outcome as a victory. A second is that Israel has demobilised most of its reservists and transferred key regular units to its northern border or the occupied West Bank. The current phase of its offensive in Gaza involves targeted strikes and raids instead of massed confrontations. For economic and political reasons, Israel\u2019s strategic planners had few options, but this means there are few troops permanently on the ground in northern Gaza.", "uid": "01_00_174", "stance": "neutral", "language": "English", "translation": "", "input": "Israel \u2019s offensive in Gaza.

For example, in October 2014, just two months after Hamas started a war with Israel in which it launched more than 10,000 missiles into civilian targets, Sarah Haniyeh, the daughter of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, was treated at Tel Aviv's Ichilov Hospital following complications she suffered in a Gaza hospital. Around the same time, but unreported, Hamas leader Haniyeh's mother-in-law and granddaughter also left Gaza for treatment in Israeli hospitals. The parade of Hamas murderers, kidnappers and genocidal Jew-hating terrorists who find no moral contradiction in seeking medical help from the very people they are sworn to wipe out boggles the mind. But then again mass murderers usually don't have guilty consciences. They range from the sister of Hamas leader Mousa Abu Marzouk to the children of Hamas military commanders who orchestrate maneuvers to carry out murderous terrorist raids on Israeli schools, towns and kibbutzes near the Gaza border. Another absurdity that separates Israeli medicine from Palestinian cynicism and hypocrisy is the example of terrorist Yahya al-Sinwar, head of the Hamas political bureau in the Gaza Strip, who, while imprisoned in Israel in 2007, was operated on to have a brain tumor removed. Now, having been released in 2011 in the Gilad Shalit prisoner exchange deal, he continues to furiously beat the Hamas drum for more and more missiles, more and more killings. Behind Palestinian hypocrisy \u2013 like the front pageNew York TimesstoryNov. 19 that the PA was preparing to stop its \"pay for slay\" program yet in Arabic, asreportedby the much more reliable Palestinian Media Watch, the PA had denied any intention to do so in Arabic-- is their twin knowledge that they can get away with anything, any lie and any terrorist attack with western audiences. Palestinian terrorist organizations \u2013 from the PLO, Hamas or Islamic Jihad \u2013 can kill as many Israelis as possible without any fear of an Israeli attack on Palestinian civilians in return, because Israel has a different moral code. At present, HamasholdsIsraeli civilians and IDF soldiers hostage in unthinkable conditions. No one knows where they are, their conditions or whether they are even alive. Hamas refuses to let the Red Cross visit them. At the same time, convicted Palestinian terrorist murderers go on hunger strikes in Israeli jails, secure in the knowledge that they can rely on the oath sworn by their Jewish doctors, their humanity and Israel's moral code, which the terrorists cynically leverage for their own ends, to get effective \"get out of jail free cards.\"", "uid": "01_04_38", "stance": "pos", "language": "English", "translation": "", "input": "Hamas leader Haniyeh's mother - in - law and granddaughter leave Gaza.

The report, by the international community\u2019s authority on determining the severity of hunger crises, came as Israel faces mounting pressure from even its closest allies to streamline the entry of aid into the Gaza Strip and to open more land crossings.

Otherwise, it is hard to understand what the senior senator from New York thought he would achieve when calling for new leadership in Israel while drawing an equivalence between the country\u2019s democratically-elected government, and the terrorist organization in Gaza that the IDF has been fighting for the last five months.This has nothing to do with what someone\u2019s opinion might be about the prime minister. There is legitimate criticism of Netanyahu and strong feelings that he should have stepped down years ago. There is no doubt that Netanyahu needs to be held personally responsible for the failures that led to this war, and it is even possible that had he done so, the October 7 massacre could have been avoided. He was the prime minister for the last 15 years (except for one) and he set the policy that allowed Hamas to grow in strength.On the other hand, he is the democratically elected prime minister of this country and the way for him to be replaced is for the Israeli people to do so at the ballot. It is not the place of a US senator \u2013 no matter how senior and how pro-Israel he might be \u2013 to lobby for elections to replace him. It is also important to keep in mind that while polls show that a new election would replace Netanyahu, those same polls show that a majority of Israelis support his government\u2019s war policies. One poll from this week saw 82% of Israelis support Netanyahu\u2019s call for an offensive against Hamas in the southern Gaza town of Rafah despite US opposition.This is a case in which two things can be true \u2013 Israelis support the policies of the government at the same time that Israelis want new leadership. But again, this is something for the Israeli people to decide. It is not the place of a foreign government to tell us how we should vote and who should run our country. Smoke rises after Israeli airstrikes as it seen from Rafah, in the southern Gaza Strip, December 1, 2023 (credit: ABED RAHIM KHATIB/FLASH90)THIS POLITICAL tension comes at a time when Israel\u2019s war against Hamas appears to be stuck. While Israel has been warning for weeks of an imminent operation in Rafah \u2013 which is needed to further degrade Hamas capabilities and destroy smuggling tunnels from Egypt \u2013 the operation is mostly being used right now as a bargaining chip to pressure Hamas to finalize a deal that brings some of the hostages home.It is mainly for this reason that Israel has yet to begin even the initial step of starting to move the displaced Gazans who are currently in the area of Rafah so they will not be caught in the crossfire if and when there is an IDF offensive in the southern Gaza town. That is the first step that will need to be taken before the first tank enters Rafah. Israel is waiting for a deal\u00a0In the meantime, while Israel waits to see if there will be a deal, on the ground the operation seems to be on hold. There is still some fighting in the central Gaza Strip as well as sporadic clashes in northern Gaza where Hamas is trying to redeploy, but when it comes to expansion of the offensive, the IDF is waiting.This same thinking applies to the operation that took place this week at Shifa Hospital where the IDF went in for what can best be described as \u201cmowing the terror lawn\u201d in Gaza.As of Thursday, the operation has been considered a success \u2013 IDF elite troops fighting alongside forces from the Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency), surrounded the hospital, prevented terrorists from leaving, captured several hundred, and killed almost 100 more.", "uid": "01_00_143", "stance": "pos", "language": "English", "translation": "", "input": "the senior senator from New York call for new leadership in Israel. the IDF fight the terrorist organization.

He and other hospital staff buried them all on Monday, he said. He also named seven doctors detained by Israeli forces during the raid or still held from a previous raid in November, among them several intensive care doctors and general surgeons.

Severely injured children endured the raid alone, without their parents or caretakers, according to the WHO.

The news team was shown a few Kalashnikovs and a motorcycle, of all things. Hagari bent over backwards trying to convince the media and the world that those were proof of his side\u2019s allegations. His claims were mirrored at al-Shifa by his subordinate, Lt Col Jonathan Conricus, who presented as \u201cevidence of terrorist activities\u201d half a dozen AK assault rifles with magazines removed, a laptop and, in a Monty Pythonesque moment, two cans of WD40 anti-rust spray. Anyone who spent time in the Middle East or in any war knows that the venerable Kalashnikovs are present virtually everywhere. It is normal, and legal, for hospitals to have armed guards to protect them from criminals, looters and anyone wanting to misuse them. But apart from the ignorance of these claims and the huge discrepancy between demonstrating a few guns and claiming a main command centre from where Hamas conducted its operations, the location where those guns were allegedly found is curious: the gloating Conricus was adamant that they were hidden in the MRI room.

Sarhan says this shift resulted in a dearth of funding and support for the cultural sector, especially the visual arts, as the international community severed ties with Gaza.  In 2009 Shababeek was formally established when Sarhan, El Maqosui and Shala rented an old house in Gaza City.

There are many other examples of the moral double standard that serves as the operative code used by the Palestinians, who ignore the old Arabic proverb, \"Don't throw stones into the well you drink from.\" Hamas and Palestinian Jihad Islamist terrorists glorify what they proudly refer to as early Islam's \"Islamic morality,\" the legacy of their seventh century beginnings in which they believed it was their intrinsic right, ordained by Allah, to impose their way on the rest of the world. Thirteen centuries later, they now love the land \"occupied\" by Israel so much that every summer they burn its forests, launch incendiary balloons to destroy its crops and year-round fire rockets into it, and indiscriminately shoot, run over and stab Israeli men, women and children. At the same time, every month the Hamas and PIJ leadership send hundreds of sick Palestinians to Israeli hospitals for complicated medical procedures. Do more harm? It is interesting that there are so many terrorists among the Arab medical establishment that has made such a prominent contribution to terrorism and murder. Ayman Zawahiri, a medical doctor, was one of the original founders of al-Qaida; Abdel Aziz al-Rantisi was a senior Hamas figure and a physician, as is Mahmoud al-Zahar (a surgeon) and Ibrahim al-Yazouri, (a pharmacist); all of them terrorist operatives to the core. But instead of fostering a modern Palestinian public health system, in building new hospitals and improving the quality of medicine in the Gaza Strip, Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad leaders invest the international community's '\"humanitarian assistance\" money in positioning missile arrays inside United Nations schools and infirmaries, building a network of underground command and attack tunnels throughout the Gaza Strip, and fortifying the bunkers they constructed under Shifaa Hospital in Gaza City. It is no wonder, then, that the Palestinian public health system cannot deal with complicated medical problems and sends its difficult cases to Israeli hospitals. In 2014, the wife of PA Chairman Mahmoud Abbas was treated in Israel. In 2018, an Israeli specialist was sent to Ramallah to treat Chairman Abbas himself, resulting in a dramatic improvement in his health. Over the years Israel has provided medical care for the relatives of the Hamas and PA leaders, whose main pastime is to spend their days thinking about and planning how to destroy the State of Israel. An unhappy aspect of this saga of hypocrisy and cant is that, while thousands of Palestinian patients are treated in Israeli hospitals and charged the same fees as Israelis, Abbas stopped paying for their care last year. PA figures are in an entirely different category. Israel facilitates the delivery of drugs and money to the Palestinian Authority, including those originating from hostile terrorist supporting countries such as the Islamist nation of Qatar.", "uid": "01_04_36", "stance": "pos", "language": "English", "translation": "", "input": "by Israel occupy the land. they destroy its crops. they shoot Israeli men, women and children. the Hamas and PIJ leadership send hundreds of sick Palestinians to Israeli hospitals. the Palestinian public health system send its difficult cases to Israeli hospitals. an Israeli specialist treat Chairman Abbas himself. the Hamas and PA leaders destroy the State of Israel.

Erekat, whom I knew personally, is a perfect example: he worked tirelessly not only to delegitimize, but to try to destroy Israel by means of economic strangulation through his unending promotion worldwide of the BDS campaign. He accused Israel of being an \"apartheid\" country, actively supported the \"resistance\" (a euphemism for Palestinian terrorism, which aims to kill Israelis), called for a tsunami of millions of \"returning Palestinian refugees\" to overwhelm Israel and demographically destroy it as the homeland of the Jewish people, and fiercely advocated ending all security and civilian coordination between Israel and the Palestinian Authority (PA). Still, despite his statements supporting terrorism and the elimination of the State of Israel, he was never rebuked by any Western government or human rights organization. In fact, Erekat was treated no differently than other members of the P.A. and Hamas who openly support and coordinate terrorism and indoctrinate their students with poisonous anti-Semitic curricula \u2013 often subsidized by European governments and large left leaning U.S. foundations. Erekat, like the late PA and Fatah leader Yasser Arafat, was born in Egypt but pretended he was Palestinian. The Erekats are Bedouins, related to a large clan based in south Jordan. It was therefore ironic, not to say weird, when the diplomatic terrorist, who refused to recognize Israel as a Jewish state and did his best to destroy it in order to establish \"Palestine\" on its ruins, would look to Hadassah Ein Kerem Hospital in Israel's capital city for help in his coronavirus plight despite the boycott he worked so hard to impose on Israeli institutions. The Jerusalem-based Sheikh Ikrima Sabri, whom I also have known personally, behaved the same way. For years, he spewed vicious propaganda and anti-Israeli and anti-American incitement from his pulpit in al-Aqsa mosque. When he was in charge as the \"Mufti\" (an Islamic legal authority), he led millions of Muslims in prayers \u2013beamed all over the Muslim world by radio and the internet \u2013 with his religious rants against the United States (\"Allah will turn the White House black...\") and religious curses calling for the \"annihilation of the Zionists\" and \"the destruction of Israel.\" But when he urgently needed heart surgery, his first choice was...the Zionist-run Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem.", "uid": "01_04_35", "stance": "pos", "language": "English", "translation": "", "input": "he destroy Israel by means of economic strangulation through his unending promotion worldwide of the BDS campaign.

The Israeli military also released a video that was recorded using two separate cameras on November 17. Spokesperson Daniel Hagari told reporters the entrance was uncovered when a military bulldozer knocked down the outside wall of the hospital, revealing a metallic spiral staircase that descended 10m (32ft) and led to a blast door, which is typically a metallic door with strong closures and hinges, designed to resist explosions. Such doors are usually found on facilities such as bomb shelters. But military analyst Zoran Kusovac quoted a civil engineer from Gaza who suggested that the video is actually clips of two different tunnels spliced together. The first section of the video shows the vertical shaft that goes down. It shows features such as load-bearing concrete columns. They seem to be built with regular civil engineering techniques, which would have required large and loud machines such as concrete mixers.

Widely seen as the region\u2019s strongest militia, many were hoping that it would open up a wide second front with Israel, including the Palestinian refugees who live in Lebanon. But Nasrallah has a complicated line to walk, as he balances domestic pressure against him with Hezbollah\u2019s role as part of the region\u2019s \u201cIslamic resistance\u201d. As one skirmish follows another and Israeli attacks hit deeper in Lebanese territory, the question becomes: How long will Hezbollah hold back? Israel has said repeatedly that its goal is to clear the tunnels under Gaza used by Hamas fighters. Yet, fighting remains above ground and any victories Israel claims seem to be largely against clusters of unarmed civilians, causing incredible destruction as it draws one weapon after the other out of its large arsenal. Our strategic analyst posits that this is likely because Israel knows that going into the tunnels will be a long, dangerous campaign for it.

Israeli forces launched what the Israel Defense Forces described as a \u201chigh-precision\u201d raid at Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City one week ago, alleging once again that the facility was being used as a Hamas hub, while fighting was also reported in recent days at two other medical facilities in the southern city of Khan Younis.\u00a0 The IDF said all of those killed and around 500 people detained in the operation were Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants, though they did not provide evidence to support those claims. They also said they had located weapons and \u201cterror infrastructure\u201d within the hospital.\u00a0 The raid has left much of Al-Shifa in ruins, with some of the walls that remain intact spattered with blood and civilians describing mass arrests. Hamas said last week that displaced civilians sheltering at the facility were among those killed, without providing evidence, while the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza said that at least five patients had died due to lack of food, water and health services. Others, it said, were in increasingly poor condition, \u201cand worms began to emerge from their wounds.\u201d\u00a0 And one Western military analyst told NBC News that the renewed operation at Al-Shifa was likely an inevitable result of Israel\u2019s shift in focus to the south, where it is preparing for an offensive the U.S. and international leaders have warned against.  Daniel Byman, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a professor at Georgetown University\u2019s School of Foreign Service, said it would be the \u201cleast surprising surprise\u201d if Hamas militants had been using Al-Shifa Hospital as a base in recent weeks, with Israel\u2019s attention turned largely toward a possible ground invasion of Rafah in Gaza\u2019s south.\u00a0 Much of what exactly has been happening on the ground at Al-Shifa and in the area of Al-Amal Hospital in southern Gaza remains unclear. NBC News\u2019 crew on the ground has had limited access to both sites due to fighting and NBC News wasn't able to reach medical workers at the hospitals or the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza over the past week. Video captured by NBC News\u2019 crew, including on-camera witness accounts, have provided a glimpse into the chaos that has unfolded at the hospital compound over the past week, however.

Consequently, they refuse to believe even the evidence of their own eyes when it conflicts with the poisonous anti-Israel consensus. Hamas understands this dynamic only too well. Western values are based on respect for human life and compassion for suffering. By contrast, Hamas, like other Islamists, privileges death over life and is motivated by psychopathic fanaticism. It understands that people in the West are horrified by the killing of innocent civilians in war, particularly children. It also understands that the West [contrary to its own wartime behavior] no longer makes a distinction between civilians who are deliberately slaughtered and civilians who are unintentionally but unavoidably killed in the course of a war to prevent further slaughter. Western populations thus put pressure on their governments to force Israel to stop defending itself against Hamas, giving Hamas the ability to continue slaughtering Israelis. So Hamas ensures that as many Gazan civilians as possible are killed under Israeli bombardment by forcing them at gunpoint to become human shields and cannon fodder. It distributes the resulting images to Western news desks ravenous for copy and that depend upon journalists and photographers who either support Hamas or understand that if they don\u2019t do what Hamas wants they will be killed. TheBBCand other Western media outlets have thus become more than useful idiots.

But mention of the clans is not incidental here. One of the most important aspects of Israel\u2019s supposed \u201cday after\u201d scenario for Gaza is that day-to-day activities would be managed by local families and tribes. Gaza\u2019s traditional clans used to hold greater sway in the coastal enclave prior to Hamas\u2019s ascendancy to power in 2007, some of them acting as lawless gangs that engaged in criminal activity. Hamas severely curtailed their role during its period of rule over the Strip, but during the latest genocidal war, many of these families took advantage of the chaos to commandeer aid convoys and hoard food aid or sell it on the black market.\u00a0 Israel has not only welcomed the development but actively encouraged the state of lawlessness. Its continued targeting of Gaza police escorts only reinforced the phenomenon. At around the same time, Israeli officials began to float the idea of postwar tribal rule in Gaza. This relates to the second part of the speculation surrounding Mabhouh\u2019s assassination \u2014 that he was involved in cracking down on clans that seized food aid, likely to be the same clans who would be contenders in Israel\u2019s vision of postwar rule in Gaza.\u00a0 One unsubstantiated rumor was widely circulated on social media in Arabic and picked up by the Israeli media: Hamas had supposedly executed the unnamed head of the influential Doghmosh clan in Gaza for allegedly stealing humanitarian aid and being suspected of collaborating with Israel. The Doghmosh clan put out a statement strongly denying the claim, asserting that the clan chief had been martyred during an Israeli airstrike on November 16, 2023. An investigation conducted by Al Jazeera revealed that the name of the family\u2019s head (the mukhtar) was on the list of the dead from that airstrike. Regardless of the veracity of the speculation, what has become clear is that Israel\u2019s genocidal war has taken on a new dimension \u2014 it is encouraging societal collapse in Gaza. Its engineering of famine and the enablement of lawlessness is simply a continuation of its military campaign through other means. And when members of the civilian government attempt to ameliorate the famine or try to work to restore social order, Israel launches a war against them, too.", "uid": "01_00_84", "stance": "neg", "language": "English", "translation": "", "input": "by the clans organize it.
