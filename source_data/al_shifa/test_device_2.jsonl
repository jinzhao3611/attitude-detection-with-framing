They hope to detonate their bombs at the precise moment they were being treated by the most number of Israeli doctors and nurses. For example, in 2005 Hamassent a Gaza womannamed Samir Ibrahim Bas to Soroka Hospital in Beersheba for life-saving treatments. But Hamas secretly padded her under-clothing with 20 pounds of high-powered explosives so she could blow up the doctors treating her in the Israeli hospital. Beyond the medical treatments given to the very terrorists sworn to destroy the Jewish state, Israel opened up a field hospital on its Syrian border in the Golan Heights to treat any wounded Syrian soldier or citizen seeking help. The IDF doctors and nurses asked no questions of any of the hundreds of wounded.

The Israeli army has spent the past several days gradually tightening its noose around the hospital. As part of its ground offensive into northern Gaza, it came in and surrounded the largest hospital in the Strip with soldiers, tanks, armoured vehicles, and attack drones supported by snipers. The Israeli troops have now made their way into the hospital and raided several departments. They set up electronic checkpoints at multiple doors of the main buildings. Their tanks are in the courtyard. This is while thousands of people are still trapped in the hospital. These include many displaced Palestinians taking shelter there, critically ill patients with nowhere to go, and exhausted medical staff and personnel. According to first-hand accounts, Israeli troops targeted generators and communications units before storming in, and they also interrogated dozens of stripped and blindfolded people who already had their access to water and basic hygiene cut off. Israel\u2019s main supporting claim for laying siege to the most important hospital in Gaza is that Hamas has a main command centre operating from within and under the hospital.

The military has described the raid on Shifa Hospital as a major battlefield victory in the nearly six-month war and said its troops killed 200 militants in the operation, though the claim they were all militants could not be confirmed. But the raid came at a time of mounting frustration in Israel, with tens of thousands protesting Sunday against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and demanding that he do more to bring home dozens of hostages held in Gaza.

In other developments, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would shut down satellite broadcaster Al Jazerra immediately. Netanyahu vowed to close the \u201cterror channel\u201d after parliament passed a law Monday clearing the way for the country to halt the Qatari-owned channel from broadcasting from Israel.

The scene was clear in its implication: attempts were being made to restore civil order in northern Gaza and to improve the lot of the suffering population. Not 24 hours later, in the predawn hours of March 18, Israel invaded al-Shifa. The news emerged that the army had assassinated Faiq Mabhouh, and that an Israeli soldier had been killed after Mabhouh reportedly refused to surrender. Suddenly all news sources were saying the same thing: Mabhouh had been behind the effort to coordinate the arrival of the aid. The information available on Mabhouh\u2019s duties remains scant, often blending fact with speculation regarding his activities and the reason for his assassination. Most media sources agree that Mabhouh organized the delivery of the aid convoy, which he did in coordination with Gaza clans, UNRWA, and international organizations. Crucially, that coordination entailed meeting with officials from those groups. One of the widespread pieces of speculation holds that it was at those meetings that Mabhouh\u2019s location was exposed and supposedly leaked to Israel\u2019s intelligence, likely through one of those international organizations. Haaretz speculates that this intelligence leak \u201cmay explain Israel\u2019s urgency to launch an immediate operation at the hospital.\u201d Being the head of a civilian police force, Mabhouh operated publicly earlier on in the war, but as Israel continued to target members of the local police, the need for secrecy became more apparent. According to Axios, the Biden administration asked Israel back in February to \u201cstop targeting members of the Hamas-run civilian police force who escort aid trucks in Gaza, warning that a \u2018total breakdown of law and order\u2019 is significantly exacerbating the humanitarian crisis.\u201d\u00a0 Israel never stopped targeting them and indeed went above and beyond in massacring hundreds of civilians seeking food.

Asking someone to believe that any hospital in Gaza would relinquish one of its main diagnostic machines to hide a grab bag with a few guns is simply absurd. The Israeli army has been successful in taking the ground in Gaza, at least on the fringes of the city proper with a few incursions deeper into the urban areas, like the advance to al-Shifa, with fairly low numbers of casualties and limited material losses. But it has failed to uncover \u2013 and show \u2013 any underground command centres or major tunnels. It was seen and filmed going down a few shafts, unopposed, but it did not appear to have gone underground in earnest. Failing to produce the underground command centre, late on Thursday, the Israeli army showed a hole in the ground claiming it to be the entrance of a Hamas military tunnel. Until the media is allowed to enter and check for itself, it will have to balance that claim against the counter-suggestion that it is an access point for an underground electrical cable. I have no doubt that there are Hamas underground bunkers, communications nodes, power stations, storage facilities and \u2013 command centres. If you take your cause underground, as Hamas obviously has, dedicating substantial resources and huge efforts to building the network, then you do construct an integrated network. Anything short of building several command facilities deep underground would be amateurish and outright foolish. Every expert must be certain that such a \u201cbeating heart of Hamas\u201d, as the Israeli army called it, is indeed ticking somewhere under Gaza.

Israel placed a blockade on the Gaza Strip after Hamas gained control of it in 2007. Tunnels became the means to bypass the siege and to transport food, goods and weapons. Under Hamas, the tunnels expanded strategically. The tunnels are also used by Hamas for wired communications, since Israel can intercept wireless communications. After attacking Gaza in 2014, Israel realised the extent and sophistication of the tunnels, then believed to have surpassed 100km (62 miles). A tunnel war would entail a whole lot of destruction. The magnitude of explosives would be larger and deadlier than usual due to the smaller area of the tunnels. For the same reason, the use of regular ammunition might be too \u201cclumsy\u201d and hence unviable. Al-Shifa is not the only hospital that Israel has alleged is used by Hamas as a military base.

At 2:00 a.m. on Monday, the Israeli army stormed al-Shifa hospital, entering with tanks and heavy gunfire and killing and injuring dozens. It was the fourth invasion of al-Shifa since October, resulting in the arrest of over 80 people.\u00a0 The day before, 13 aid trucks arrived in northern Gaza for the first time in four months without being turned back by the Israeli army or resulting in the massacre of starving Palestinian aid-seekers. People flocking to the UNRWA warehouse in Jabalia refugee camp to receive the aid stood in uncharacteristically orderly lines and patiently waited for the handouts of flour, rice, and other foodstuffs. Many could be seen cheering once the aid arrived, a scene captured by Al Jazeera\u2019s coverage. But what few people know is that this successful delivery of sorely needed food aid to northern Gaza is what led the Israeli army to launch its deadly raid on al-Shifa Hospital the next day. The connection between these two events can only be explained by understanding who Israel was targeting in the raid \u2014 the now-martyred Faiq Mabhouh. Mabhouh was the Director of Operations of the Gaza police force, a part of the Gaza government\u2019s civilian administration. Unlike Hamas\u2019s military wing, the Qassam Brigades, Mabhouh did not operate clandestinely at the start of the war, because he didn\u2019t have to \u2014 he was in charge of civil law enforcement. Hamas released a statement after his death confirming that he \u201cengaged in purely civil and humanitarian activity.\u201d\u00a0 Yet to hear Israeli military spokespersons and the Israeli media, Israel had launched a \u201cprecise operation\u201d on al-Shifa to target a \u201ctop Hamas operative,\u201d or a \u201csenior Hamas commander,\u201d who the army alleged was planning attacks on Israel. Making such brazen claims without evidence to justify attacking hospitals and shelters has been a hallmark of the Israeli army\u2019s conduct throughout its genocidal assault. But the true significance of the attack lies not in its desire to empty northern Gaza\u2019s largest civilian refuge, which houses 30,000 people, but in foiling Faiq Mabhouh\u2019s pivotal role in coordinating the delivery of humanitarian aid to starving civilians in Gaza while restoring a semblance of social order to the north.", "uid": "01_00_81", "stance": "neg", "language": "English", "translation": "", "input": "the Israeli army kill dozens. the Israeli army injure dozens.

The Palestinian factions also\u00a0strongly condemned the continued Israeli targeting of hospitals intending to destroy the health sector in the Gaza Strip. In a statement, the factions considered that \"Israel's\" goal is to\u00a0deny any chance of survival, treatment, or care for the wounded and patients, pointing out that this is evidenced by the deprivation of thousands from traveling to receive medical treatment and their pursuit in hospitals. The statement\u00a0affirmed the falsehood of the Israeli occupation's narratives and baseless claims, making it clear that hospitals are civilian health institutions where no activities are conducted that contradict their defined functions and duties according to international humanitarian law. The Islamic Resistance Movement - Hamas and al-Mujahideen Movement released separate statements condemning the attack on al-Shifa Hospital.\u00a0 On its part, Hamas said that the continued Israeli crimes against civilians are an \"expression of the state of disarray and confusion\" of the Israeli leadership, saying that it also represents a \"loss of hope in achieving any military achievement\" in the Gaza Strip.\u00a0 It stressed that the failure of the international community and the United Nations to take swift action against Israeli acts of genocide and war crimes has awarded the occupation's military the \"green light\" to continue the war on Gaza. The movement demanded that the International Committee of the Red Cross and the World Health Organization, as well as other international organizations, abide by their responsibilities of protecting what remains of Gaza's medical facilities, which \"Israel\" seeks to destroy as part of its genocide of Palestinians. Al-Mujahideen Movement held the United States, western governments, \"defeatist\" Arab states, and the international system, responsible for the continued Israeli acts of genocide against the people of Gaza.

Hospital staff had to bury dozens of people in a mass grave on the grounds as they were out of options. Dead bodies lie around its courtyard still. Beyond that, al-Shifa is seen as a nerve centre for the Gaza government\u2019s administrative bodies. Health ministry officials have held press conferences amid the corpses there, and the government\u2019s media ministry has operated out of the hospital. Al-Shifa kept its internet connectivity at times when the rest of Gaza was cut off by Israel, so it has also been a hot spot for journalists, some of whom are trapped there now. The hospital\u2019s director and its doctors and staff have been providing constant updates whenever possible, often rejecting Israeli claims \u2013 like one on Wednesday that it had allowed aid into the hospital. For some Palestinians, the hospital has become a symbol of strength and standing up to a militarily stronger force that shows little restraint. Images of dead babies and maimed children that have been broadcast from inside the hospital to the world have inspired many millions to take to the streets in support of Palestinians. Israel has said it wants to take charge of Gaza\u2019s security in the future. It has contradicted its main ally, the United States, on that point since Washington wants the Palestinian Authority to take over. But they seem to be on the same page on \u201cdestroying\u201d Hamas, so the ground operation would need to expand for that to happen. Taking over the main hospital in town would be essential in that scenario. But just as al-Shifa has found new meaning among Palestinians and those watching from around the globe, what happens at the hospital has become paramount for Israel. Israel wants to dismantle the hub that al-Shifa has become and take over what it has said it sees as the stronghold of Hamas\u2019s military and administrative capabilities.", "uid": "01_01_29", "stance": "neg", "language": "English", "translation": "", "input": "Israeli troops blow its dwindling stores of medicine up.
